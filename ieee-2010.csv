IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,History of US Government Investments in Cybersecurity Research: A Personal Perspective,"This paper traces the history of cybersecurity research funding by the U.S. government. Difficulties in accurately measuring the level of U.S. government research funding for cybersecurity are first described. Some of the legislative and bureaucratic mechanisms involved in funding and reporting such research today are reviewed. A qualitative, personal perspective on the ups and downs of US cybersecurity research funding from the late 1960s to 2010 is then provided. The essay is written for the thirtieth anniversary meeting of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, held in May 2010.","investment, public finance, security of data, US government investment history, cybersecurity research, legislative mechanisms, bureaucratic mechanisms, funding, IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy, History, US Government, Investments, Computer security, Privacy, Information security, Educational institutions, USA Councils, Uninterruptible power systems, Meetings, cybersecurity research, research funding, HPC, NCO, NITRD, CSIA, information assurance, computer security, information security,"

IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Inspector Gadget: Automated Extraction of Proprietary Gadgets from Malware Binaries,"Unfortunately, malicious software is still an unsolved problem and a major threat on the Internet. An important component in the fight against malicious software is the analysis of malware samples: Only if an analyst understands the behavior of a given sample, she can design appropriate countermeasures. Manual approaches are frequently used to analyze certain key algorithms, such as downloading of encoded updates, or generating new DNS domains for command and control purposes. In this paper, we present a novel approach to automatically extract, from a given binary executable, the algorithm related to a certain activity of the sample. We isolate and extract these instructions and generate a so-called gadget, i.e., a stand-alone component that encapsulates a specific behavior. We make sure that a gadget can autonomously perform a specific task by including all relevant code and data into the gadget such that it can be executed in a self-contained fashion. Gadgets are useful entities in analyzing malicious software: In particular, they are valuable for practitioners, as understanding a certain activity that is embedded in a binary sample (e.g., the update function) is still largely a manual and complex task. Our evaluation with several real-world samples demonstrates that our approach is versatile and useful in practice.","Internet, invasive software, malicious software, Internet, DNS domains, proprietary gadgets, inspector gadget, malware binaries, Algorithm design and analysis, Internet, Security, Electronic mail, Communication system control, Privacy, USA Councils, Command and control systems, Data mining, Embedded software,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Synthesizing Near-Optimal Malware Specifications from Suspicious Behaviors,"Fueled by an emerging underground economy, malware authors are exploiting vulnerabilities at an alarming rate. To make matters worse, obfuscation tools are commonly available, and much of the malware is open source, leading to a huge number of variants. Behavior-based detection techniques are a promising solution to this growing problem. However, these detectors require precise specifications of malicious behavior that do not result in an excessive number of false alarms. In this paper, we present an automatic technique for extracting optimally discriminative specifications, which uniquely identify a class of programs. Such a discriminative specification can be used by a behavior-based malware detector. Our technique, based on graph mining and concept analysis, scales to large classes of programs due to probabilistic sampling of the specification space. Our implementation, called Holmes, can synthesize discriminative specifications that accurately distinguish between programs, sustaining an 86% detection rate on new, unknown malware, with 0 false positives, in contrast with 55% for commercial signature-based antivirus (AV) and 62-64% for behavior-based AV (commercial or research).","data mining, formal specification, graph theory, invasive software, sampling methods, near-optimal malware specifications, behavior-based detection techniques, malicious behavior specification, discriminative specifications, behavior-based malware detector, graph mining, concept analysis, probabilistic sampling, Holmes implementation, Detectors, Computer hacking, Humans, Computer security, Privacy, Computer science, Sampling methods, Credit cards, Internet, Art, Malware, Specification, Probabilistic Optimization, Software Security,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Identifying Dormant Functionality in Malware Programs,"To handle the growing flood of malware, security vendors and analysts rely on tools that automatically identify and analyze malicious code. Current systems for automated malware analysis typically follow a dynamic approach, executing an unknown program in a controlled environment (sandbox) and recording its runtime behavior. Since dynamic analysis platforms directly run malicious code, they are resilient to popular malware defense techniques such as packing and code obfuscation. Unfortunately, in many cases, only a small subset of all possible malicious behaviors is observed within the short time frame that a malware sample is executed. To mitigate this issue, previous work introduced techniques such as multipath or forced execution to increase the coverage of dynamic malware analysis. Unfortunately, using these techniques is potentially expensive, as the number of paths that require analysis can grow exponentially. In this paper, we propose REANIMATOR, a novel solution to determine the capabilities (malicious functionality) of malware programs. Our solution is based on the insight that we can leverage behavior observed while dynamically executing a specific malware sample to identify similar functionality in other programs. More precisely, when we observe malicious actions during dynamic analysis, we automatically extract and model the parts of the malware binary that are responsible for this behavior. We then leverage these models to check whether similar code is present in other samples. This allows us to statically identify dormant functionality (functionality that is not observed during dynamic analysis) in malicious programs. We evaluate our approach on thousands of realworld malware samples, and we show that our system is successful in identifying additional, malicious functionality. As a result, our approach can significantly improve the coverage of malware analysis results.","data analysis, invasive software, dormant functionality identification, malware programs, malicious code, sandbox environment, packing technique, code obfuscation technique, malicious behaviors, dynamic malware analysis, multipath technique, forced execution technique, Reanimator solution, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic, Educational institutions, malware analysis, dormant functionality, binary analysis,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Reconciling Belief and Vulnerability in Information Flow,"Belief and vulnerability have been proposed recently to quantify information flow in security systems. Both concepts stand as alternatives to the traditional approaches founded on Shannon entropy and mutual information, which were shown to provide inadequate security guarantees. In this paper we unify the two concepts in one model so as to cope with (potentially inaccurate) attackers' extra knowledge. To this end we propose a new metric based on vulnerability that takes into account the adversary's beliefs.","entropy, probability, security of data, Shannon entropy, information flow, security systems, probabilistic approaches, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic, Educational institutions, Security, information hiding, information flow, quantitative and probabilistic models, uncertainty, accuracy, data confidentiality, belief, vulnerability,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Towards Static Flow-Based Declassification for Legacy and Untrusted Programs,"Simple non-interference is too restrictive for specifying and enforcing information flow policies in most programs. Exceptions to non-interference are provided using declassification policies. Several approaches for enforcing declassification have been proposed in the literature. In most of these approaches, the declassification policies are embedded in the program itself or heavily tied to the variables in the program being analyzed, thereby providing little separation between the code and the policy. Consequently, the previous approaches essentially require that the code be trusted, since to trust that the correct policy is being enforced, we need to trust the source code. In this paper, we propose a novel framework in which declassification policies are related to the source code being analyzed via its I/O channels. The framework supports many of the of declassification policies identified in the literature. Based on flow-based static analysis, it represents a first step towards a new approach that can be applied to untrusted and legacy source code to automatically verify that the analyzed program complies with the specified declassification policies. The analysis works by constructing a conservative approximation of expressions over input channel values that could be output by the program, and by determining whether all such expressions satisfy the declassification requirements stated in the policy. We introduce a representation of such expressions that resembles tree automata. We prove that if a program is considered safe according to our analysis then it satisfies a property we call Policy Controlled Release, which formalizes information-flow correctness according to our notion of declassification policy. We demonstrate, through examples, that our approach works for several interesting and useful declassification policies, including one involving declassification of the average of several confidential values.","data flow analysis, security of data, software maintenance, static flow based declassification, legacy programs, untrusted programs, information flow policies, source code, I/O channels, flow based static analysis, policy controlled release, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic, Educational institutions,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Noninterference through Secure Multi-execution,"A program is defined to be noninterferent if its outputs cannot be influenced by inputs at a higher security level than their own. Various researchers have demonstrated how this property (or closely related properties) can be achieved through information flow analysis, using either a static analysis (with a type system or otherwise), or using a dynamic monitoring system. We propose an alternative approach, based on a technique we call secure multi-execution. The main idea is to execute a program multiple times, once for each security level, using special rules for I/O operations. Outputs are only produced in the execution linked to their security level. Inputs are replaced by default inputs except in executions linked to their security level or higher. Input side effects are supported by making higher-security-level executions reuse inputs obtained in lower-security-level threads. We show that this approach is interesting from both a theoretical and practical viewpoint. Theoretically, we prove for a simple deterministic language with I/O operations, that this approach guarantees complete soundness (even for the timing and termination covert channels), as well as good precision (identical I/O for terminating runs of termination-sensitively noninterferent programs). On the practical side, we present an experiment implementing secure multi-execution in the mainstream Spidermonkey Javascript engine, exploiting parallelism on a current multi-core computer. Benchmark results of execution time and memory for the Google Chrome v8 Benchmark suite show that the approach is practical for a mainstream browser setting. Certain programs are even executed faster under secure multi-execution than under the standard execution. We discuss challenges and propose possible solutions for implementing the technique in a real browser, in particular handling the DOM tree and browser callback functions. Finally, we discuss how secure multi-execution can be extended to handle language features like exceptions, concurrency or nondeterminism.","data analysis, security of data, secure multiexecution technique, noninterferent program, information flow analysis, static analysis, dynamic monitoring system, lower-security-level threads, Spidermonkey Javascript engine, Google Chrome v8 Benchmark suite, DOM tree, browser callback functions, exception feature, concurrency feature, nondeterminism feature, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic, Educational institutions, Secure Multi-Execution, Information Flow, Noninterference,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Object Capabilities and Isolation of Untrusted Web Applications,"A growing number of current web sites combine active content (applications) from untrusted sources, as in so-called mashups. The object-capability model provides an appealing approach for isolating untrusted content: if separate applications are provided disjoint capabilities, a sound object capability framework should prevent untrusted applications from interfering with each other, without preventing interaction with the user or the hosting page. In developing language-based foundations for isolation proofs based on object-capability concepts, we identify a more general notion of authority safety that also implies resource isolation. After proving that capability safety implies authority safety, we show the applicability of our framework for a specific class of mashups. In addition to proving that a JavaScript subset based on Google Caja is capability safe, we prove that a more expressive subset of JavaScript is authority safe, even though it is not based on the object-capability model.","Java, Web sites, object capabilities, object isolation, untrusted Web applications, Web sites, mashups, resource isolation, JavaScript subset, Google Caja, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic, Educational institutions, Language-based Security, Capabilities, Operational Semantics, JavaScript,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,TrustVisor: Efficient TCB Reduction and Attestation,"An important security challenge is to protect the execution of security-sensitive code on legacy systems from malware that may infect the OS, applications, or system devices. Prior work experienced a tradeoff between the level of security achieved and efficiency. In this work, we leverage the features of modern processors from AMD and Intel to overcome the tradeoff to simultaneously achieve a high level of security and high performance. We present TrustVisor, a special-purpose hypervisor that provides code integrity as well as data integrity and secrecy for selected portions of an application. TrustVisor achieves a high level of security, first because it can protect sensitive code at a very fine granularity, and second because it has a very small code base (only around 6K lines of code) that makes verification feasible. TrustVisor can also attest the existence of isolated execution to an external entity. We have implemented TrustVisor to protect security-sensitive code blocks while imposing less than 7% overhead on the legacy OS and its applications in the common case.","data integrity, invasive software, operating systems (computers), software maintenance, legacy system, security-sensitive code block, malware, AMD, Intel, TrustVisor, code integrity, data integrity, legacy OS system, operating system, Hardware, Circuit testing, Computer security, Process design, Runtime, Costs, Logic, Algorithm design and analysis, Privacy, Arm, Trusted Computing, Integrity Measurement, Attestation, Minimal TCB, Virtualization, TPM,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Overcoming an Untrusted Computing Base: Detecting and Removing Malicious Hardware Automatically,"The computer systems security arms race between attackers and defenders has largely taken place in the domain of software systems, but as hardware complexity and design processes have evolved, novel and potent hardware-based security threats are now possible. This paper presents a hybrid hardware/software approach to defending against malicious hardware. We propose BlueChip, a defensive strategy that has both a design-time component and a runtime component. During the design verification phase, BlueChip invokes a new technique, unused circuit identification (UCI), to identify suspicious circuitry-those circuits not used or otherwise activated by any of the design verification tests. BlueChip removes the suspicious circuitry and replaces it with exception generation hardware. The exception handler software is responsible for providing forward progress by emulating the effect of the exception generating instruction in software, effectively providing a detour around suspicious hardware. In our experiments, BlueChip is able to prevent all hardware attacks we evaluate while incurring a small runtime overhead.","exception handling, hardware-software codesign, program verification, security of data, untrusted computing base, malicious hardware removal, computer systems security, hardware complexity, hardware based security threats, hybrid hardware-software approach, BlueChip, design verification phase, unused circuit identification, exception generation hardware, exception handler software, Hardware, Circuit testing, Computer security, Process design, Runtime, Costs, Logic, Algorithm design and analysis, Privacy, Arm,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Tamper Evident Microprocessors,"Most security mechanisms proposed to date unquestioningly place trust in microprocessor hardware. This trust, however, is misplaced and dangerous because microprocessors are vulnerable to insider attacks that can catastrophically compromise security, integrity and privacy of computer systems. In this paper, we describe several methods to strengthen the fundamental assumption about trust in microprocessors. By employing practical, lightweight attack detectors within a microprocessor, we show that it is possible to protect against malicious logic embedded in microprocessor hardware. We propose and evaluate two area-efficient hardware methods - TrustNet and DataWatch - that detect attacks on microprocessor hardware by knowledgeable, malicious insiders. Our mechanisms leverage the fact that multiple components within a microprocessor (e.g., fetch, decode pipeline stage etc.) must necessarily coordinate and communicate to execute even simple instructions, and that any attack on a microprocessor must cause erroneous communications between micro architectural subcomponents used to build a processor. A key aspect of our solution is that TrustNet and DataWatch are themselves highly resilient to corruption. We demonstrate that under realistic assumptions, our solutions can protect pipelines and on-chip cache hierarchies at negligible area cost and with no performance impact. Combining TrustNet and DataWatch with prior work on fault detection has the potential to provide complete coverage against a large class of microprocessor attacks.","data privacy, microprocessor chips, security mechanisms, tamper evident microprocessors, insider attacks, attack detectors, malicious logic, TrustNet method, DataWatch method, microprocessor trust, Microprocessors, Hardware, Protection, Pipelines, Computer security, Privacy, Logic, Decoding, Costs, Fault detection, hardware security, backdoors, microprocessors,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,"Side-Channel Leaks in Web Applications: A Reality Today, a Challenge Tomorrow","With software-as-a-service becoming mainstream, more and more applications are delivered to the client through the Web. Unlike a desktop application, a web application is split into browser-side and server-side components. A subset of the application's internal information flows are inevitably exposed on the network. We show that despite encryption, such a side-channel information leak is a realistic and serious threat to user privacy. Specifically, we found that surprisingly detailed sensitive information is being leaked out from a number of high-profile, top-of-the-line web applications in healthcare, taxation, investment and web search: an eavesdropper can infer the illnesses/medications/surgeries of the user, her family income and investment secrets, despite HTTPS protection; a stranger on the street can glean enterprise employees' web search queries, despite WPA/WPA2 Wi-Fi encryption. More importantly, the root causes of the problem are some fundamental characteristics of web applications: stateful communication, low entropy input for better interaction, and significant traffic distinctions. As a result, the scope of the problem seems industry-wide. We further present a concrete analysis to demonstrate the challenges of mitigating such a threat, which points to the necessity of a disciplined engineering practice for side-channel mitigations in future web application developments.","client-server systems, security of data, Web services, software-as-a-service, Web application, server side component, browser side component, side channel information leak, HTTPS protection, Hardware, Circuit testing, Computer security, Process design, Runtime, Costs, Logic, Algorithm design and analysis, Privacy, Arm, side-channel-leak, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), web application, encrypted traffic, ambiguity set, padding,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Investigation of Triangular Spamming: A Stealthy and Efficient Spamming Technique,"Spam is increasingly accepted as a problem associated with compromised hosts or email accounts. This problem not only makes the tracking of spam sources difficult but also enables a massive amount of illegitimate or unwanted emails to be disseminated quickly. Various attempts have been made to analyze, backtrack, detect, and prevent spam using both network as well as content characteristics. However, relatively less attention has been given to understanding how spammers actually carry out their spamming activities from a network angle. Spammers' network behavior has significant impact on spammers' common goal, sending spam in a stealthy and efficient manner. Our work thoroughly investigates a fairly unknown spamming technique we name as triangular spamming that exploits routing irregularities of spoofed IP packets. It is highly stealthy and efficient in that triangular spamming enables 1) exploiting bandwidth diversity of botnet hosts to carry out spam campaigns effectively without divulging precious high-bandwidth hosts and 2) bypassing the current SMTP traffic blocking policies. Despite its relative obscurity, its use has been confirmed by the network operator community. Through carefully devised probing techniques and actual deployment of triangular spamming on Planetlab (a wide-area distributed testbed), we investigate the feasibility, impact of triangular spamming and propose practical detection and prevention methods. From our probing experiments, we found that 97% of the networks which block outbound SMTP traffic are vulnerable to triangular spamming and only 44% of them are listed on Spamhaus Policy Blocking List (PBL).","IP networks, telecommunication security, telecommunication traffic, unsolicited e-mail, triangular spamming, stealthy spamming technique, illegitimate emails, spoofed IP packets, botnet, outbound SMTP traffic blocking policies, network operator community, Planetlab, Spamhaus Policy Blocking List, bandwidth diversity, Telecommunication traffic, Relays, Filtering, Electronic mail, Network servers, Security, Privacy, Silicon, Routing, Bandwidth,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,A Practical Attack to De-anonymize Social Network Users,"Social networking sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Xing have been reporting exponential growth rates and have millions of registered users. In this paper, we introduce a novel de-anonymization attack that exploits group membership information that is available on social networking sites. More precisely, we show that information about the group memberships of a user (i.e., the groups of a social network to which a user belongs) is sufficient to uniquely identify this person, or, at least, to significantly reduce the set of possible candidates. That is, rather than tracking a user's browser as with cookies, it is possible to track a person. To determine the group membership of a user, we leverage well-known web browser history stealing attacks. Thus, whenever a social network user visits a malicious website, this website can launch our de-anonymization attack and learn the identity of its visitors. The implications of our attack are manifold, since it requires a low effort and has the potential to affect millions of social networking users. We perform both a theoretical analysis and empirical measurements to demonstrate the feasibility of our attack against Xing, a medium-sized social network with more than eight million members that is mainly used for business relationships. Furthermore, we explored other, larger social networks and performed experiments that suggest that users of Facebook and LinkedIn are equally vulnerable.","online front-ends, security of data, social networking (online), social network users deanonymization, Facebook, Linkedln, Xing, group membership information, cookies, Web browser history stealing attacks, malicious Website, History, Browsers, Facebook, Web pages, LinkedIn, Business,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,SCiFI - A System for Secure Face Identification,"We introduce SCiFI, a system for Secure Computation of Face Identification. The system performs face identification which compares faces of subjects with a database of registered faces. The identification is done in a secure way which protects both the privacy of the subjects and the confidentiality of the database. A specific application of SCiFI is reducing the privacy impact of camera based surveillance. In that scenario, SCiFI would be used in a setting which contains a server which has a set of faces of suspects, and client machines which might be cameras acquiring images in public places. The system runs a secure computation of a face recognition algorithm, which identifies if an image acquired by a client matches one of the suspects, but otherwise reveals no information to neither of the parties. Our work includes multiple contributions in different areas: 1. A new face identification algorithm which is unique in having been specifically designed for usage in secure computation. Nonetheless, the algorithm has face recognition performance comparable to that of state of the art algorithms. We ran experiments which show the algorithm to be robust to different viewing conditions, such as illumination, occlusions, and changes in appearance (like wearing glasses). 2. A secure protocol for computing the new face recognition algorithm. In addition, since our goal is to run an actual system, considerable effort was made to optimize the protocol and minimize its online latency. 3. A system - SCiFI, which implements a secure computation of the face identification protocol. 4. Experiments which show that the entire system can run in near real-time: The secure computation protocol performs a preprocessing of all public-key cryptographic operations. Its online performance therefore mainly depends on the speed of data communication, and our experiments show it to be extremely efficient.","cryptographic protocols, data privacy, face recognition, public key cryptography, visual databases, SCiFI system, secure computation, face identification, registered face database, camera based surveillance, face recognition algorithm, illumination condition, occlusion condition, appearance condition, secure computation protocol, public-key cryptographic operation, Face recognition, Cryptographic protocols, Cameras, Protection, Data privacy, Image databases, Surveillance, Algorithm design and analysis, Radio access networks, Robustness, Secure computation, face recognition, privacy,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Round-Efficient Broadcast Authentication Protocols for Fixed Topology Classes,"We consider resource-constrained broadcast authentication for n receivers in a static, known network topology. There are only two known broadcast authentication protocols that do not use asymmetric cryptography, one-time signatures, multi-receiver MACs, or time synchronization. Both these protocols require three passes of a message front traversing the network. We investigate whether this amount of interaction can be improved efficiently for specific common topology classes, namely, linear topologies, tree topologies and fully connected topologies. We show modifications to the protocols allowing them to complete in just two passes in the linear and fully connected cases with a small constant factor increase in per-node communication overhead, and a further optimization that achieves the equivalent of just a single pass in the linear case with O(log n) increase in per-node communication overhead. We also prove new lower bounds for round complexity, or the maximum number of consecutive interactions in a protocol. We show that protocols with efficient per-node communication overhead (polylogarithmic in n) must require at least 2 log n rounds in any topology; this implies that our two-pass protocol in the fully-connected topology requires the fewest possible passes, and this bound is asymptotically tight for the full-duplex communication model. Furthermore, we show that communication-efficient protocols must take asymptotically more than 2 log n rounds on trees; this implies that that there are some tree topologies for which two passes do not suffice and the existing three-pass algorithms may be optimal.","computational complexity, cryptographic protocols, digital signatures, optimisation, topology, broadcast authentication protocols, fixed topology class, resource-constrained broadcast authentication, asymmetric cryptography, one-time signatures, multi-receiver MACs, time synchronization, linear topology, tree topology, fully connected topology, per-node communication overhead, optimization, round complexity, full-duplex communication model, message authentication codes, Broadcasting, Authentication, Network topology, Cryptographic protocols, Cryptography, Optimization methods, Privacy, USA Councils, Computer security, Computer networks, Multicast Authentication, Broadcast Authentication, Linear Topology, Path Topology, Fully Connected Topology,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Revocation Systems with Very Small Private Keys,"In this work, we design a method for creating public key broadcast encryption systems. Our main technical innovation is based on a new ""two equation"" technique for revoking users. This technique results in two key contributions: First, our new scheme has ciphertext size overhead O(r), where r is the number of revoked users, and the size of public and private keys is only a constant number of group elements from an elliptic-curve group of prime order. In addition, the public key allows us to encrypt to an unbounded number of users. Our system is the first to achieve such parameters. We give two versions of our scheme: a simpler version which we prove to be selectively secure in the standard model under a new, but non-interactive assumption, and another version that employs the new dual system encryption technique of Waters to obtain adaptive security under the d-BDH and decisional Linear assumptions. Second, we show that our techniques can be used to realize Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE) systems with nonmonotonic access formulas, where our key storage is significantly more efficient than previous solutions. This result is also proven selectively secure in the standard model under our new non-interactive assumption.","public key cryptography, revocation systems, small private keys, public key broadcast encryption systems, ciphertext size overhead, revoked users, elliptic curve group, adaptive security, d-BDH, decisional linear assumptions, attribute based encryption systems, Public key, Satellite broadcasting, Security, Public key cryptography, Elliptic curve cryptography, Wireless sensor networks, Privacy, Design methodology, Technological innovation, Equations,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Authenticating Primary Users' Signals in Cognitive Radio Networks via Integrated Cryptographic and Wireless Link Signatures,"To address the increasing demand for wireless bandwidth, cognitive radio networks (CRNs) have been proposed to increase the efficiency of channel utilization; they enable the sharing of channels among secondary (unlicensed) and primary (licensed) users on a non-interference basis. A secondary user in a CRN should constantly monitor for the presence of a primary user's signal to avoid interfering with the primary user. However, to gain unfair share of radio channels, an attacker (e.g., a selfish secondary user) may mimic a primary user's signal to evict other secondary users. Therefore, a secure primary user detection method that can distinguish a primary user's signal from an attacker's signal is needed. A unique challenge in addressing this problem is that Federal Communications Commission (FCC) prohibits any modification to primary users. Consequently, existing cryptographic techniques cannot be used directly. In this paper, we develop a novel approach for authenticating primary users' signals in CRNs, which conforms to FCC's requirement. Our approach integrates cryptographic signatures and wireless link signatures (derived from physical radio channel characteristics) to enable primary user detection in the presence of attackers. Essential to our approach is a {\em helper node} placed physically close to a primary user. The helper node serves as a ""bridge"" to enable a secondary user to verify cryptographic signatures carried by the helper node's signals and then obtain the helper node's authentic link signatures to verify the primary user's signals. A key contribution in our paper is a novel physical layer authentication technique that enables the helper node to authenticate signals from its associated primary user. Unlike previous techniques for link signatures, our approach explores the geographical proximity of the helper node to the primary user, and thus does not require any training process.","cognitive radio, cryptography, wireless channels, primary users signals authentication, cognitive radio networks, integrated cryptographic signatures, wireless link signatures, wireless bandwidth, radio channels, geographical proximity, physical layer authentication technique, Cognitive radio, Cryptography, Signal processing, TV, Computer vision, Bandwidth, Monitoring, FCC, Software radio, Computer security, cognitive radio networks, primary user detection, link signatures,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Outside the Closed World: On Using Machine Learning for Network Intrusion Detection,"In network intrusion detection research, one popular strategy for finding attacks is monitoring a network's activity for anomalies: deviations from profiles of normality previously learned from benign traffic, typically identified using tools borrowed from the machine learning community. However, despite extensive academic research one finds a striking gap in terms of actual deployments of such systems: compared with other intrusion detection approaches, machine learning is rarely employed in operational ""real world"" settings. We examine the differences between the network intrusion detection problem and other areas where machine learning regularly finds much more success. Our main claim is that the task of finding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it significantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively. We support this claim by identifying challenges particular to network intrusion detection, and provide a set of guidelines meant to strengthen future research on anomaly detection.","learning (artificial intelligence), security of data, machine learning, network intrusion detection, anomaly detection, Machine learning, Intrusion detection, Computer science, Telecommunication traffic, Guidelines, Computer security, National security, Privacy, Laboratories, Computerized monitoring, anomaly detection, machine learning, intrusion detection, network security,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,All You Ever Wanted to Know about Dynamic Taint Analysis and Forward Symbolic Execution (but Might Have Been Afraid to Ask),"Dynamic taint analysis and forward symbolic execution are quickly becoming staple techniques in security analyses. Example applications of dynamic taint analysis and forward symbolic execution include malware analysis, input filter generation, test case generation, and vulnerability discovery. Despite the widespread usage of these two techniques, there has been little effort to formally define the algorithms and summarize the critical issues that arise when these techniques are used in typical security contexts. The contributions of this paper are two-fold. First, we precisely describe the algorithms for dynamic taint analysis and forward symbolic execution as extensions to the run-time semantics of a general language. Second, we highlight important implementation choices, common pitfalls, and considerations when using these techniques in a security context.","data analysis, security of data, dynamic taint analysis, forward symbolic execution, security analysis, malware analysis, input filter generation, test case generation, vulnerability discovery, security context, Filters, Runtime, Information analysis, Testing, Computerized monitoring, Performance analysis, Information security, Reactive power, Privacy, Heuristic algorithms, taint analysis, symbolic execution, dynamic analysis,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,State of the Art: Automated Black-Box Web Application Vulnerability Testing,"Black-box web application vulnerability scanners are automated tools that probe web applications for security vulnerabilities. In order to assess the current state of the art, we obtained access to eight leading tools and carried out a study of: (i) the class of vulnerabilities tested by these scanners, (ii) their effectiveness against target vulnerabilities, and (iii) the relevance of the target vulnerabilities to vulnerabilities found in the wild. To conduct our study we used a custom web application vulnerable to known and projected vulnerabilities, and previous versions of widely used web applications containing known vulnerabilities. Our results show the promise and effectiveness of automated tools, as a group, and also some limitations. In particular, ""stored"" forms of Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection (SQLI) vulnerabilities are not currently found by many tools. Because our goal is to assess the potential of future research, not to evaluate specific vendors, we do not report comparative data or make any recommendations about purchase of specific tools.","program testing, security of data, cross site scripting, SQL injection, black box scanners, Web vulnerability detection, Automatic testing, Data security, Probes, Privacy, Code standards, Computer hacking, Forgery, Credit cards, Personnel, Decision support systems,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,A Proof-Carrying File System,"We present the design and implementation of PCFS, a file system that adapts proof-carrying authorization to provide direct, rigorous, and efficient enforcement of dynamic access policies. The keystones of PCFS are a new authorization logic BL that supports policies whose consequences may change with both time and system state, and a rigorous enforcement mechanism that combines proof verification with conditional capabilities. We prove that our enforcement using capabilities is correct, and evaluate our design through performance measurements and a case study.","authorisation, formal logic, formal verification, proof-carrying file system, proof-carrying authorization, dynamic access policy, BL authorization logic, enforcement mechanism, proof verification, conditional capability, File systems, Authorization, Principal component analysis, Monitoring, Access control, Throughput, Delay, Control systems, Logic design, Computer security, Access control, logic, proof-carrying authorization, file system,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Scalable Parametric Verification of Secure Systems: How to Verify Reference Monitors without Worrying about Data Structure Size,"The security of systems such as operating systems, hypervisors, and web browsers depend critically on reference monitors to correctly enforce their desired security policy in the presence of adversaries. Recent progress in developing reference monitors with small code size and narrow interfaces has made automated formal verification of reference monitors a more tractable goal. However, a significant remaining factor for the complexity of automated verification is the size of the data structures (e.g., access control matrices) over which the programs operate. This paper develops a parametric verification technique that scales even when reference monitors and adversaries operate over unbounded, but finite data structures. Specifically, we develop a parametric guarded command language for modeling reference monitors and adversaries. We also present a parametric temporal specification logic for expressing security policies that the monitor is expected to enforce. The central technical results of the paper are a set of small model theorems. These theorems state that in order to verify that a policy is enforced by a reference monitor with an arbitrarily large data structure, it is sufficient to model check the monitor with just one entry in its data structure. We apply our methodology to verify the designs of two hypervisors, SecVisor and the sHype mandatory-access-control extension to Xen. Our approach is able to prove that sHype and a variant of the original SecVisor design correctly enforces the expected security properties in the presence of powerful adversaries.","data structures, formal verification, security of data, supervisory programs, temporal logic, scalable parametric verification, secure systems, reference monitors, automated formal verification, data structures, parametric guarded command language, parametric temporal specification logic, Data structures, Data security, Virtual machine monitors, Logic, Power system security, Operating systems, Command languages, Virtual machining, System software, Scalability, security, parametric verification, model checking, small model theorem, reference monitor, hypervisor, SecVisor,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,HyperSafe: A Lightweight Approach to Provide Lifetime Hypervisor Control-Flow Integrity,"Virtualization is being widely adopted in today's computing systems. Its unique security advantages in isolating and introspecting commodity OSes as virtual machines (VMs) have enabled a wide spectrum of applications. However, a common, fundamental assumption is the presence of a trustworthy hypervisor. Unfortunately, the large code base of commodity hypervisors and recent successful hypervisor attacks (e.g., VM escape) seriously question the validity of this assumption. In this paper, we present HyperSafe, a lightweight approach that endows existing Type-I bare-metal hypervisors with a unique self-protection capability to provide lifetime control flow integrity. Specifically, we propose two key techniques. The first one, non-bypassable memory lockdown, reliably protects the hypervisor's code and static data from being compromised even in the presence of exploitable memory corruption bugs (e.g., buffer overflows), therefore successfully providing hypervisor code integrity. The second one, restricted pointer indexing, introduces one layer of indirection to convert the control data into pointer indexes. These pointer indexes are restricted such that the corresponding call/return targets strictly follow the hypervisor control flow graph, hence expanding protection to control-flow integrity. We have built a prototype and used it to protect two open-source Type-I hypervisors: BitVisor and Xen. The experimental results with synthetic hypervisor exploits and benchmarking programs show HyperSafe can reliably enable the hypervisor self-protection and provide the integrity guarantee with a small performance overhead.","data privacy, formal verification, operating systems (computers), virtual machines, HyperSafe approach, lifetime hypervisor control, control-flow integrity, virtualization, commodity OS, operating systems, virtual machines, trustworthy hypervisor, hypervisor attacks, type-I bare-metal hypervisors, self-protection capability, nonbypassable memory lockdown technique, restricted pointer indexing technique, hypervisor control flow graph, hypervisor code integrity, Virtual machine monitors, Lighting control, Protection, Security, Virtual machining, Voice mail, Virtual manufacturing, Computer bugs, Buffer overflow, Indexing, Hypervisor, Rootkits, Control-Flow Integrity,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,How Good Are Humans at Solving CAPTCHAs? A Large Scale Evaluation,"Captchas are designed to be easy for humans but hard for machines. However, most recent research has focused only on making them hard for machines. In this paper, we present what is to the best of our knowledge the first large scale evaluation of captchas from the human perspective, with the goal of assessing how much friction captchas present to the average user. For the purpose of this study we have asked workers from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and an underground captchabreaking service to solve more than 318 000 captchas issued from the 21 most popular captcha schemes (13 images schemes and 8 audio scheme). Analysis of the resulting data reveals that captchas are often difficult for humans, with audio captchas being particularly problematic. We also find some demographic trends indicating, for example, that non-native speakers of English are slower in general and less accurate on English-centric captcha schemes. Evidence from a week's worth of eBay captchas (14,000,000 samples) suggests that the solving accuracies found in our study are close to real-world values, and that improving audio captchas should become a priority, as nearly 1% of all captchas are delivered as audio rather than images. Finally our study also reveals that it is more effective for an attacker to use Mechanical Turk to solve captchas than an underground service.","security of data, user interfaces, CAPTCHAs, human perspective, machine perspective, completely automated public turing tests, computers and humans apart, underground captchabreaking service, Amazon mechanical turk, images scheme, audio scheme, English-centric captcha schemes, Humans, Large-scale systems, Demography, Statistics, Mechanical variables measurement, Security, Privacy, Friction, Automatic testing, Speech, captchas, image, audio, humans, mechanical turk,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Bootstrapping Trust in Commodity Computers,"Trusting a computer for a security-sensitive task (such as checking email or banking online) requires the user to know something about the computer's state. We examine research on securely capturing a computer's state, and consider the utility of this information both for improving security on the local computer (e.g., to convince the user that her computer is not infected with malware) and for communicating a remote computer's state (e.g., to enable the user to check that a web server will adequately protect her data). Although the recent ""Trusted Computing"" initiative has drawn both positive and negative attention to this area, we consider the older and broader topic of bootstrapping trust in a computer. We cover issues ranging from the wide collection of secure hardware that can serve as a foundation for trust, to the usability issues that arise when trying to convey computer state information to humans. This approach unifies disparate research efforts and highlights opportunities for additional work that can guide real-world improvements in computer security.","computer bootstrapping, security of data, bootstrapping trust, commodity computers, security sensitive task, checking email, banking online, security improvement, malware, remote computers state, trusted computing, computer state information, computer security, Computer security, Hardware, Cellular phones, Web server, Humans, Central Processing Unit, Privacy, Banking, Data security, Information security, Trust, Trusted Computing, Bootstrap, TPM, Trusted Platform Module, Secure Boot, Code Identity,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Chip and PIN is Broken,"EMV is the dominant protocol used for smart card payments worldwide, with over 730 million cards in circulation. Known to bank customers as “Chip and PIN”, it is used in Europe; it is being introduced in Canada; and there is pressure from banks to introduce it in the USA too. EMV secures credit and debit card transactions by authenticating both the card and the customer presenting it through a combination of cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, and the entry of a PIN. In this paper we describe and demonstrate a protocol flaw which allows criminals to use a genuine card to make a payment without knowing the card's PIN, and to remain undetected even when the merchant has an online connection to the banking network. The fraudster performs a man-in-the-middle attack to trick the terminal into believing the PIN verified correctly, while telling the card that no PIN was entered at all. The paper considers how the flaws arose, why they remained unknown despite EMV's wide deployment for the best part of a decade, and how they might be fixed. Because we have found and validated a practical attack against the core functionality of EMV, we conclude that the protocol is broken. This failure is significant in the field of protocol design, and also has important public policy implications, in light of growing reports of fraud on stolen EMV cards. Frequently, banks deny such fraud victims a refund, asserting that a card cannot be used without the correct PIN, and concluding that the customer must be grossly negligent or lying. Our attack can explain a number of these cases, and exposes the need for further research to bridge the gap between the theoretical and practical security of bank payment systems. It also demonstrates the need for the next version of EMV to be engineered properly.","bank data processing, cryptographic protocols, digital signatures, smart cards, EMV protocol, smart card payments, Chip-and-PIN, credit card transactions, debit card transactions, cryptographic authentication codes, digital signatures, PIN entry, man-in-the-middle attack, bank payment systems, Smart cards, Europe, Cryptography, Authentication, Digital signatures, Cryptographic protocols, Banking, Public policy, Bridges, Security, EMV, Chip and PIN, card fraud, bank security, protocol failure, security economics, authentication,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,Experimental Security Analysis of a Modern Automobile,"Modern automobiles are no longer mere mechanical devices; they are pervasively monitored and controlled by dozens of digital computers coordinated via internal vehicular networks. While this transformation has driven major advancements in efficiency and safety, it has also introduced a range of new potential risks. In this paper we experimentally evaluate these issues on a modern automobile and demonstrate the fragility of the underlying system structure. We demonstrate that an attacker who is able to infiltrate virtually any Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can leverage this ability to completely circumvent a broad array of safety-critical systems. Over a range of experiments, both in the lab and in road tests, we demonstrate the ability to adversarially control a wide range of automotive functions and completely ignore driver input\dash including disabling the brakes, selectively braking individual wheels on demand, stopping the engine, and so on. We find that it is possible to bypass rudimentary network security protections within the car, such as maliciously bridging between our car's two internal subnets. We also present composite attacks that leverage individual weaknesses, including an attack that embeds malicious code in a car's telematics unit and that will completely erase any evidence of its presence after a crash. Looking forward, we discuss the complex challenges in addressing these vulnerabilities while considering the existing automotive ecosystem.","automotive engineering, safety-critical software, security of data, traffic engineering computing, ubiquitous computing, experimental security analysis, modern automobile, mechanical devices, pervasively monitoring, digital computers, internal vehicular networks, electronic control unit, safety-critical systems, cars telematics unit, malicious code, automotive ecosystem, Security, Automobiles, Automotive engineering, Computerized monitoring, Computer networks, Pervasive computing, Safety, Control systems, Roads, Testing, Automobiles, communication standards, communication system security, computer security, data buses,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,On the Incoherencies in Web Browser Access Control Policies,"Web browsers' access control policies have evolved piecemeal in an ad-hoc fashion with the introduction of new browser features. This has resulted in numerous incoherencies. In this paper, we analyze three major access control flaws in today's browsers: (1) principal labeling is different for different resources, raising problems when resources interplay, (2) runtime changes to principal identities are handled inconsistently, and (3) browsers mismanage resources belonging to the user principal. We show that such mishandling of principals leads to many access control incoherencies, presenting hurdles for web developers to construct secure web applications. A unique contribution of this paper is to identify the compatibility cost of removing these unsafe browser features. To do this, we have built WebAnalyzer, a crawler-based framework for measuring real-world usage of browser features, and used it to study the top 100,000 popular web sites ranked by Alexa. Our methodology and results serve as a guideline for browser designers to balance security and backward compatibility.","authorisation, online front-ends, Web browser, access control policy, principal labeling flaw, principal identity flaw, resource management flaw, access control incoherency, WebAnalyzer framework, security compatibility, backward compatibility, Access control, Labeling, Runtime, Costs, Security, Privacy, Intrusion detection, Displays, Access protocols, Navigation,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,ConScript: Specifying and Enforcing Fine-Grained Security Policies for JavaScript in the Browser,"Much of the power of modern Web comes from the ability of a Web page to combine content and JavaScript code from disparate servers on the same page. While the ability to create such mash-ups is attractive for both the user and the developer because of extra functionality, code inclusion effectively opens the hosting site up for attacks and poor programming practices within every JavaScript library or API it chooses to use. In other words, expressiveness comes at the price of losing control. To regain the control, it is therefore valuable to provide means for the hosting page to restrict the behavior of the code that the page may include. This paper presents ConScript, a client-side advice implementation for security, built on top of Internet Explorer 8. ConScript allows the hosting page to express fine-grained application-specific security policies that are enforced at runtime. In addition to presenting 17 widely-ranging security and reliability policies that ConScript enables, we also show how policies can be generated automatically through static analysis of server-side code or runtime analysis of client-side code. We also present a type system that helps ensure correctness of ConScript policies. To show the practicality of ConScript in a range of settings, we compare the overhead of ConScript enforcement and conclude that it is significantly lower than that of other systems proposed in the literature, both on micro-benchmarks as well as large, widely-used applications such as MSN, GMail, Google Maps, and Live Desktop.","application program interfaces, Internet, Java, security of data, fine-grained security policy, JavaScript, Web page, ConScript mechanism, code inclusion, application program interface, client-side advice implementation, Internet Explorer 8, static analysis, runtime analysis, server-side code, client-side code, Security, Java, Libraries, Runtime, Web pages, Functional programming, Internet, HTML, Computer bugs, Privacy, JavaScript, Web and client-side programming, aspects, browsers, language security, security policies,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,TaintScope: A Checksum-Aware Directed Fuzzing Tool for Automatic Software Vulnerability Detection,"Fuzz testing has proven successful in finding security vulnerabilities in large programs. However, traditional fuzz testing tools have a well-known common drawback: they are ineffective if most generated malformed inputs are rejected in the early stage of program running, especially when target programs employ checksum mechanisms to verify the integrity of inputs. In this paper, we present TaintScope, an automatic fuzzing system using dynamic taint analysis and symbolic execution techniques, to tackle the above problem. TaintScope has several novel contributions: 1) TaintScope is the first checksum-aware fuzzing tool to the best of our knowledge. It can identify checksum fields in input instances, accurately locate checksum-based integrity checks by using branch profiling techniques, and bypass such checks via control flow alteration. 2) TaintScope is a directed fuzzing tool working at X86 binary level (on both Linux and Window). Based on fine-grained dynamic taint tracing, TaintScope identifies which bytes in a well-formed input are used in security-sensitive operations (e.g., invoking system/library calls) and then focuses on modifying such bytes. Thus, generated inputs are more likely to trigger potential vulnerabilities. 3) TaintScope is fully automatic, from detecting checksum, directed fuzzing, to repairing crashed samples. It can fix checksum values in generated inputs using combined concrete and symbolic execution techniques. We evaluate TaintScope on a number of large real-world applications. Experimental results show that TaintScope can accurately locate the checksum checks in programs and dramatically improve the effectiveness of fuzz testing. TaintScope has already found 27 previously unknown vulnerabilities in several widely used applications, including Adobe Acrobat, Google Picasa, Microsoft Paint, and ImageMagick. Most of these severe vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Secunia and oCERT, and assigned CVE identifiers (such as CVE-2009-1882, CVE-2009-2688). Corresponding patches from vendors are released or in progress based on our reports.","program diagnostics, program testing, safety-critical software, TaintScope, checksum-aware directed fuzzing tool, automatic software vulnerability detection, fuzz testing, automatic fuzzing system, dynamic taint analysis, symbolic execution techniques, checksum-based integrity checks, branch profiling techniques, X86 binary level, Secunia, oCERT, CVE identifiers, Software tools, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic, fuzzing, dynamic taint analysis, symbolic execution,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2010,A Symbolic Execution Framework for JavaScript,"As AJAX applications gain popularity, client-side JavaScript code is becoming increasingly complex. However, few automated vulnerability analysis tools for JavaScript exist. In this paper, we describe the first system for exploring the execution space of JavaScript code using symbolic execution. To handle JavaScript code's complex use of string operations, we design a new language of string constraints and implement a solver for it. We build an automatic end-to-end tool, Kudzu, and apply it to the problem of finding client-side code injection vulnerabilities. In experiments on 18 live web applications, Kudzu automatically discovers 2 previously unknown vulnerabilities and 9 more that were previously found only with a manually-constructed test suite.","Java, program diagnostics, security of data, symbolic execution framework, AJAX applications, client-side JavaScript code, string operations, string constraints, client-side code injection vulnerabilities, Java, Computer architecture, Computational modeling, Registers, Assembly, Digital signal processing, Digital signal processing chips, Telecommunication control, Large scale integration, Logic,"

IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,All Your IFCException Are Belong to Us,"Existing designs for fine-grained, dynamic information-flow control assume that it is acceptable to terminate the entire system when an incorrect flow is detected-i.e, they give up availability for the sake of confidentiality and integrity. This is an unrealistic limitation for systems such as long-running servers. We identify public labels and delayed exceptions as crucial ingredients for making information-flow errors recoverable in a sound and usable language, and we propose two new error-handling mechanisms that make all errors recoverable. The first mechanism builds directly on these basic ingredients, using not-a-values (NaVs) and data flow to propagate errors. The second mechanism adapts the standard exception model to satisfy the extra constraints arising from information flow control, converting thrown exceptions to delayed ones at certain points. We prove that both mechanisms enjoy the fundamental soundness property of non-interference. Finally, we describe a prototype implementation of a full-scale language with NaVs and report on our experience building robust software components in this setting.","data flow analysis, error handling, software reliability, system recovery, fine-grained dynamic information flow control, public labels, delayed exceptions, information flow error recovery, error-handling mechanisms, not-a-values, data flow, standard exception model, fundamental soundness property, noninterference property, full-scale language, NaV, robust software components, IFCException, Servers, Standards, Security, Context, Availability, Calculus, Data structures, dynamic information flow control, fine-grained labeling, availability, reliability, error recovery, exception handling, programming-language design, public labels, delayed exceptions, not-a-values, NaVs,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,"Declarative, Temporal, and Practical Programming with Capabilities","New operating systems, such as the Capsicum capability system, allow a programmer to write an application that satisfies strong security properties by invoking security-specific system calls at a few key points in the program. However, rewriting an application to invoke such system calls correctly is an error-prone process: even the Capsicum developers have reported difficulties in rewriting programs to correctly invoke system calls. This paper describes capweave, a tool that takes as input (i) an LLVM program, and (ii) a declarative policy of the possibly-changing capabilities that a program must hold during its execution, and rewrites the program to use Capsicum system calls to enforce the policy. Our experiments demonstrate that capweave can be applied to rewrite security-critical UNIX utilities to satisfy practical security policies. capweave itself works quickly, and the runtime overhead incurred in the programs that capweave produces is generally low for practical workloads.","program compilers, program verification, rewriting systems, security of data, software tools, Unix, declarative programming, practical programming, temporal programming, operating systems, security-specific system calls, error-prone process, Capsicum developers, Capsicum capability system, program rewriting, capweave, LLVM program, declarative policy, Capsicum system calls, security-critical UNIX utilities, security policy, runtime overhead, Instruments, Security, Uniform resource locators, Weaving, Servers, Operating systems, Semantics, capabilities, safety games,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Towards Practical Reactive Security Audit Using Extended Static Checkers,"This paper describes our experience of performing reactive security audit of known security vulnerabilities in core operating system and browser COM components, using an extended static checker HAVOCLITE. We describe the extensions made to the tool to be applicable on such large C++ components, along with our experience of using an extended static checker in the large. We argue that the use of such checkers as a configurable static analysis in the hands of security auditors can be an effective tool for finding variations of known vulnerabilities. The effort has led to finding and fixing around 70 previously unknown security vulnerabilities in over 10 millions lines operating system and browser code.","C++ language, formal verification, operating systems (computers), program compilers, security of data, practical reactive security audit, extended static checkers, security vulnerabilities, core operating system, browser COM components, extended static checker HAVOCLITE, C++ components, configurable static analysis, security auditors, browser code, Security, Instruments, Object oriented modeling, Browsers, Manuals, Contracts, Semantics, security audit, program verification, static analysis, extended static checking,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,SoK: Eternal War in Memory,"Memory corruption bugs in software written in low-level languages like C or C++ are one of the oldest problems in computer security. The lack of safety in these languages allows attackers to alter the program's behavior or take full control over it by hijacking its control flow. This problem has existed for more than 30 years and a vast number of potential solutions have been proposed, yet memory corruption attacks continue to pose a serious threat. Real world exploits show that all currently deployed protections can be defeated. This paper sheds light on the primary reasons for this by describing attacks that succeed on today's systems. We systematize the current knowledge about various protection techniques by setting up a general model for memory corruption attacks. Using this model we show what policies can stop which attacks. The model identifies weaknesses of currently deployed techniques, as well as other proposed protections enforcing stricter policies. We analyze the reasons why protection mechanisms implementing stricter polices are not deployed. To achieve wide adoption, protection mechanisms must support a multitude of features and must satisfy a host of requirements. Especially important is performance, as experience shows that only solutions whose overhead is in reasonable bounds get deployed. A comparison of different enforceable policies helps designers of new protection mechanisms in finding the balance between effectiveness (security) and efficiency. We identify some open research problems, and provide suggestions on improving the adoption of newer techniques.","program debugging, security of data, software reliability, storage management, SoK, computer security, memory corruption bugs, memory corruption attacks, protection techniques, protection mechanisms, Computer bugs, Safety, Security, Programming, Arrays, Aerospace electronics, Memory management,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,The Parrot Is Dead: Observing Unobservable Network Communications,"In response to the growing popularity of Tor and other censorship circumvention systems, censors in non-democratic countries have increased their technical capabilities and can now recognize and block network traffic generated by these systems on a nationwide scale. New censorship-resistant communication systems such as Skype Morph, Stego Torus, and Censor Spoofer aim to evade censors' observations by imitating common protocols like Skype and HTTP. We demonstrate that these systems completely fail to achieve unobservability. Even a very weak, local censor can easily distinguish their traffic from the imitated protocols. We show dozens of passive and active methods that recognize even a single imitated session, without any need to correlate multiple network flows or perform sophisticated traffic analysis. We enumerate the requirements that a censorship-resistant system must satisfy to successfully mimic another protocol and conclude that ""unobservability by imitation"" is a fundamentally flawed approach. We then present our recommendations for the design of unobservable communication systems.","computer networks, data privacy, security of data, telecommunication traffic, unobservable network communications, Tor, censorship circumvention systems, network traffic recognition, network traffic blocking, censorship-resistant communication systems, SkypeMorph, StegoTorus, CensorSpoofer, Skype protocol, HTTP protocol, unobservability by imitation, parrot circumvention systems, Protocols, MIMICs, Bridges, Servers, IP networks, Cryptography, Ports (Computers), Censorship circumvention, unobservable communications, Tor pluggable transports,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,"Trawling for Tor Hidden Services: Detection, Measurement, Deanonymization","Tor is the most popular volunteer-based anonymity network consisting of over 3000 volunteer-operated relays. Apart from making connections to servers hard to trace to their origin it can also provide receiver privacy for Internet services through a feature called ""hidden services"". In this paper we expose flaws both in the design and implementation of Tor's hidden services that allow an attacker to measure the popularity of arbitrary hidden services, take down hidden services and deanonymize hidden services. We give a practical evaluation of our techniques by studying: (1) a recent case of a botnet using Tor hidden services for command and control channels; (2) Silk Road, a hidden service used to sell drugs and other contraband; (3) the hidden service of the DuckDuckGo search engine.","data privacy, Internet, search engines, Tor hidden services, volunteer based anonymity network, volunteer operated relays, Internet service privacy, arbitrary hidden services, deanonymize hidden services, command and control channels, Silk Road, DuckDuckGo search engine, Relays, Bandwidth, IP networks, Malware, Servers, Privacy, Web and internet services, Tor, anonymity network, privacy, hidden services,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,SoK: P2PWNED - Modeling and Evaluating the Resilience of Peer-to-Peer Botnets,"Centralized botnets are easy targets for takedown efforts by computer security researchers and law enforcement. Thus, botnet controllers have sought new ways to harden the infrastructures of their botnets. In order to meet this objective, some botnet operators have (re)designed their botnets to use Peer-to-Peer (P2P) infrastructures. Many P2P botnets are far more resilient to takedown attempts than centralized botnets, because they have no single points of failure. However, P2P botnets are subject to unique classes of attacks, such as node enumeration and poisoning. In this paper, we introduce a formal graph model to capture the intrinsic properties and fundamental vulnerabilities of P2P botnets. We apply our model to current P2P botnets to assess their resilience against attacks. We provide assessments on the sizes of all eleven active P2P botnets, showing that some P2P botnet families contain over a million bots. In addition, we have prototyped several mitigation strategies to measure the resilience of existing P2P botnets. We believe that the results from our analysis can be used to assist security researchers in evaluating mitigation strategies against current and future P2P botnets.","computer network security, peer-to-peer computing, SoK, P2PWNED, centralized botnets, computer security researchers, law enforcement, botnet operators, peer-to-peer infrastructures, node enumeration, node poisoning, formal graph model, intrinsic properties, active P2P botnets, mitigation strategies, Peer-to-peer computing, Resilience, Storms, Protocols, Malware, Topology, Servers,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Finding the Linchpins of the Dark Web: a Study on Topologically Dedicated Hosts on Malicious Web Infrastructures,"Malicious Web activities continue to be a major threat to the safety of online Web users. Despite the plethora forms of attacks and the diversity of their delivery channels, in the back end, they are all orchestrated through malicious Web infrastructures, which enable miscreants to do business with each other and utilize others' resources. Identifying the linchpins of the dark infrastructures and distinguishing those valuable to the adversaries from those disposable are critical for gaining an upper hand in the battle against them. In this paper, using nearly 4 million malicious URL paths crawled from different attack channels, we perform a large-scale study on the topological relations among hosts in the malicious Web infrastructure. Our study reveals the existence of a set of topologically dedicated malicious hosts that play orchestrating roles in malicious activities. They are well connected to other malicious hosts and do not receive traffic from legitimate sites. Motivated by their distinctive features in topology, we develop a graph-based approach that relies on a small set of known malicious hosts as seeds to detect dedicate malicious hosts in a large scale. Our method is general across the use of different types of seed data, and results in an expansion rate of over 12 times in detection with a low false detection rate of 2%. Many of the detected hosts operate as redirectors, in particular Traffic Distribution Systems (TDSes) that are long-lived and receive traffic from new attack campaigns over time. These TDSes play critical roles in managing malicious traffic flows. Detecting and taking down these dedicated malicious hosts can therefore have more impact on the malicious Web infrastructures than aiming at short-lived doorways or exploit sites.","Internet, security of data, telecommunication traffic, linchpins, dark Web, topologically dedicated hosts, malicious Web infrastructures, malicious URL paths, attack channels, malicious hosts, graph-based approach, seed data, low false detection rate, traffic distribution systems, TDS, short-lived doorways, Uniform resource locators, Feeds, Twitter, Topology, Servers, Crawlers, Labeling,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,The Crossfire Attack,"We present the Crossfire attack -- a powerful attack that degrades and often cuts off network connections to a variety of selected server targets (e.g., servers of an enterprise, a city, a state, or a small country) by flooding only a few network links. In Crossfire, a small set of bots directs low intensity flows to a large number of publicly accessible servers. The concentration of these flows on the small set of carefully chosen links floods these links and effectively disconnects selected target servers from the Internet. The sources of the Crossfire attack are undetectable by any targeted servers, since they no longer receive any messages, and by network routers, since they receive only low-intensity, individual flows that are indistinguishable from legitimate flows. The attack persistence can be extended virtually indefinitely by changing the set of bots, publicly accessible servers, and target links while maintaining the same disconnection targets. We demonstrate the attack feasibility using Internet experiments, show its effects on a variety of chosen targets (e.g., servers of universities, US states, East and West Coasts of the US), and explore several countermeasures.","computer network security, telecommunication links, telecommunication network routing, crossfire attack persistence, network connections, network link floods, bot connection, publicly accessible servers, target servers, network routers, legitimate flows, disconnection target links, Servers, Internet, Bandwidth, IP networks, Measurement, Educational institutions, Protocols,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Ghost Talk: Mitigating EMI Signal Injection Attacks against Analog Sensors,"Electromagnetic interference (EMI) affects circuits by inducing voltages on conductors. Analog sensing of signals on the order of a few millivolts is particularly sensitive to interference. This work (1) measures the susceptibility of analog sensor systems to signal injection attacks by intentional, low-power emission of chosen electromagnetic waveforms, and (2) proposes defense mechanisms to reduce the risks. Our experiments use specially crafted EMI at varying power and distance to measure susceptibility of sensors in implantable medical devices and consumer electronics. Results show that at distances of 1-2m, consumer electronic devices containing microphones are vulnerable to the injection of bogus audio signals. Our measurements show that in free air, intentional EMI under 10 W can inhibit pacing and induce defibrillation shocks at distances up to 1-2m on implantable cardiac electronic devices. However, with the sensing leads and medical devices immersed in a saline bath to better approximate the human body, the same experiment decreases to about 5 cm. Our defenses range from prevention with simple analog shielding to detection with a signal contamination metric based on the root mean square of waveform amplitudes. Our contribution to securing cardiac devices includes a novel defense mechanism that probes for forged pacing pulses inconsistent with the refractory period of cardiac tissue.","biological tissues, biomedical transducers, electromagnetic interference, interference suppression, mean square error methods, medical signal processing, microphones, ghost talk, EMI signal injection attack mitigation, electromagnetic interference, conductor, analog sensor system, low-power emission, electromagnetic waveform, EMI, medical device, consumer electronics, microphone, bogus audio signal, implantable cardiac electronic device, saline bath, signal contamination metric, root mean square, waveform amplitude, cardiac tissue, power 10 W, Electromagnetic interference, Sensors, Frequency modulation, Baseband, Resonant frequency, Microphones, Electrocardiography, Attacks and defenses, embedded systems security, hardware security, analog sensors,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,On Limitations of Friendly Jamming for Confidentiality,"Wireless communication provides unique security challenges, but also enables novel ways to defend against attacks. In the past few years, a number of works discussed the use of friendly jamming to protect the confidentiality of the communicated data as well as to enable message authentication and access control. In this work, we analytically and experimentally evaluate the confidentiality that can be achieved by the use of friendly jamming, given an attacker with multiple receiving antennas. We construct a MIMO-based attack that allows the attacker to recover data protected by friendly jamming and refine the conditions for which this attack is most effective. Our attack shows that friendly jamming cannot provide strong confidentiality guarantees in all settings. We further test our attack in a setting where friendly jamming is used to protect the communication to medical implants.","antenna arrays, biomedical communication, jamming, MIMO communication, prosthetics, radio networks, receiving antennas, telecommunication security, wireless communication, security, friendly jamming, confidentiality protection, message authentication, access control, multiple receiving antenna, MIMO-based attack, data recover protection, medical implant, Jamming, Antennas, Transmitters, Security, MIMO, Receivers, Implants, Friendly Jamming, Anti-Jamming, IMD,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Ally Friendly Jamming: How to Jam Your Enemy and Maintain Your Own Wireless Connectivity at the Same Time,"This paper presents a novel mechanism, called Ally Friendly Jamming, which aims at providing an intelligent jamming capability that can disable unauthorized (enemy) wireless communication but at the same time still allow authorized wireless devices to communicate, even if all these devices operate at the same frequency. The basic idea is to jam the wireless channel continuously but properly control the jamming signals with secret keys, so that the jamming signals are unpredictable interference to unauthorized devices, but are recoverable by authorized ones equipped with the secret keys. To achieve the ally friendly jamming capability, we develop new techniques to generate ally jamming signals, to identify and synchronize with multiple ally jammers. This paper also reports the analysis, implementation, and experimental evaluation of ally friendly jamming on a software defined radio platform. Both the analytical and experimental results indicate that the proposed techniques can effectively disable enemy wireless communication and at the same time maintain wireless communication between authorized devices.","jamming, software radio, wireless channels, ally friendly intelligent jamming, wireless connectivity, wireless communication device, wireless channel, jamming signal control, interference, software defined radio platform, Jamming, Wireless communication, Synchronization, Receivers, Correlation, Communication system security, Noise, Wireless, friendly jamming, interference cancellation,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Practical Timing Side Channel Attacks against Kernel Space ASLR,"Due to the prevalence of control-flow hijacking attacks, a wide variety of defense methods to protect both user space and kernel space code have been developed in the past years. A few examples that have received widespread adoption include stack canaries, non-executable memory, and Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR). When implemented correctly (i.e., a given system fully supports these protection methods and no information leak exists), the attack surface is significantly reduced and typical exploitation strategies are severely thwarted. All modern desktop and server operating systems support these techniques and ASLR has also been added to different mobile operating systems recently. In this paper, we study the limitations of kernel space ASLR against a local attacker with restricted privileges. We show that an adversary can implement a generic side channel attack against the memory management system to deduce information about the privileged address space layout. Our approach is based on the intrinsic property that the different caches are shared resources on computer systems. We introduce three implementations of our methodology and show that our attacks are feasible on four different x86-based CPUs (both 32- and 64-bit architectures) and also applicable to virtual machines. As a result, we can successfully circumvent kernel space ASLR on current operating systems. Furthermore, we also discuss mitigation strategies against our attacks, and propose and implement a defense solution with negligible performance overhead.","operating systems (computers), security of data, virtual machines, timing side channel attacks, kernel space ASLR, address space layout randomization, control-flow hijacking attacks, defense methods, kernel space code, user space code, stack canaries, non-executable memory, modern desktop, server operating systems, mobile operating systems, local attacker, channel attack, memory management system, intrinsic property, computer systems, x86-based CPU, virtual machines, mitigation strategies, word length 32 bit, word length 64 bit, Kernel, Aerospace electronics, Layout, Timing, Memory management, Linux, Address Space Layout Randomization, Timing Attacks, Kernel Vulnerabilities, Exploit Mitigation,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,PrivExec: Private Execution as an Operating System Service,"Privacy has become an issue of paramount importance for many users. As a result, encryption tools such as True Crypt, OS-based full-disk encryption such as File Vault, and privacy modes in all modern browsers have become popular. However, although such tools are useful, they are not perfect. For example, prior work has shown that browsers still leave many traces of user information on disk even if they are started in private browsing mode. In addition, disk encryption alone is not sufficient, as key disclosure through coercion remains possible. Clearly, it would be useful and highly desirable to have OS-level support that provides strong privacy guarantees for any application -- not only browsers. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of PrivExec, the first operating system service for private execution. PrivExec provides strong, general guarantees of private execution, allowing any application to execute in a mode where storage writes, either to the filesystem or to swap, will not be recoverable by others during or after execution. PrivExec does not require explicit application support, recompilation, or any other preconditions. We have implemented a prototype of PrivExec by extending the Linux kernel that is performant, practical, and that secures sensitive data against disclosure.","cryptography, data privacy, file organisation, Linux, online front-ends, PrivExec framework, encryption tools, TrueCrypt, OS-based full-disk encryption, FileVault, privacy modes, user information, private browsing mode, disk encryption, operating system service, private execution, filesystem, Linux kernel, sensitive data security, Containers, Kernel, Linux, Privacy, Encryption, Browsers, privacy, operating systems,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,A Hybrid Architecture for Interactive Verifiable Computation,"We consider interactive, proof-based verifiable computation: how can a client machine specify a computation to a server, receive an answer, and then engage the server in an interactive protocol that convinces the client that the answer is correct, with less work for the client than executing the computation in the first place? Complexity theory and cryptography offer solutions in principle, but if implemented naively, they are ludicrously expensive. Recently, however, several strands of work have refined this theory and implemented the resulting protocols in actual systems. This work is promising but suffers from one of two problems: either it relies on expensive cryptography, or else it applies to a restricted class of computations. Worse, it is not always clear which protocol will perform better for a given problem.We describe a system that (a) extends optimized refinements of the non-cryptographic protocols to a much broader class of computations, (b) uses static analysis to fail over to the cryptographic ones when the non-cryptographic ones would be more expensive, and (c) incorporates this core into a built system that includes a compiler for a high-level language, a distributed server, and GPU acceleration. Experimental results indicate that our system performs better and applies more widely than the best in the literature.","interactive systems, protocols, interactive verifiable computation, built system, GPU acceleration, distributed server, high-level language, static analysis, noncryptographic protocols, cryptography, complexity theory, interactive protocol, client machine, proof-based verifiable computation, hybrid architecture, Protocols, Cryptography, Logic gates, Computational modeling, Servers, Context, Mathematical model,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Pinocchio: Nearly Practical Verifiable Computation,"To instill greater confidence in computations outsourced to the cloud, clients should be able to verify the correctness of the results returned. To this end, we introduce Pinocchio, a built system for efficiently verifying general computations while relying only on cryptographic assumptions. With Pinocchio, the client creates a public evaluation key to describe her computation; this setup is proportional to evaluating the computation once. The worker then evaluates the computation on a particular input and uses the evaluation key to produce a proof of correctness. The proof is only 288 bytes, regardless of the computation performed or the size of the inputs and outputs. Anyone can use a public verification key to check the proof. Crucially, our evaluation on seven applications demonstrates that Pinocchio is efficient in practice too. Pinocchio's verification time is typically 10ms: 5-7 orders of magnitude less than previous work; indeed Pinocchio is the first general-purpose system to demonstrate verification cheaper than native execution (for some apps). Pinocchio also reduces the worker's proof effort by an additional 19-60x. As an additional feature, Pinocchio generalizes to zero-knowledge proofs at a negligible cost over the base protocol. Finally, to aid development, Pinocchio provides an end-to-end toolchain that compiles a subset of C into programs that implement the verifiable computation protocol.","C language, cryptographic protocols, formal verification, program compilers, public key cryptography, Pinocchio, verifiable computation protocol, correctness verification, cryptographic assumptions, public evaluation key, public verification key, general-purpose system, zero-knowledge proofs, base protocol, end-to-end toolchain, Logic gates, Polynomials, Protocols, Wires, Cryptography, Encoding,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,ObliviStore: High Performance Oblivious Cloud Storage,"We design and build ObliviStore, a high performance, distributed ORAM-based cloud data store secure in the malicious model. To the best of our knowledge, ObliviStore is the fastest ORAM implementation known to date, and is faster by 10X or more in comparison with the best known ORAM implementation. ObliviStore achieves high throughput by making I/O operations asynchronous. Asynchrony introduces security challenges, i.e., we must prevent information leakage not only through access patterns, but also through timing of I/O events. We propose various practical optimizations which are key to achieving high performance, as well as techniques for a data center to dynamically scale up a distributed ORAM. We show that with 11 trusted machines (each with a modern CPU), and 20 Solid State Drives, ObliviStore achieves a throughput of 31.5MB/s with a block size of 4KB.","cloud computing, input-output programs, parallel processing, security of data, storage allocation, ObliviStore, high-performance oblivious cloud storage, high-performance distributed ORAM-based cloud data storage, malicious model, asynchronous I/O operations, information leakage prevention, access patterns, I/O event timing, data center, CPU, solid state drives, block size, throughput, Servers, Cloud computing, Timing, Distributed databases, Cryptography, Hardware, oram, oblivious ram, oblivious storage, oblivistore, file system,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Hiding Information in Flash Memory,"This paper introduces a novel information hiding technique for Flash memory. The method hides data within an analog characteristic of Flash, the program time of individual bits. Because the technique uses analog behaviors, normal Flash memory operations are not affected and hidden information is invisible in the data stored in the memory. Even if an attacker checks a Flash chip's analog characteristics, experimental results indicate that the hidden information is difficult to distinguish from inherent manufacturing variation or normal wear on the device. Moreover, the hidden data can survive erasure of the Flash memory data, and the technique can be used on current Flash chips without hardware changes.","data encapsulation, flash memories, information hiding technique, analog characteristics, manufacturing variation, flash memory data, flash chips, Flash memories, Stress, Payloads, Logic gates, Error correction codes, Transistors, Standards, flash memory, security, steganography,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,PUFs in Security Protocols: Attack Models and Security Evaluations,"In recent years, PUF-based schemes have not only been suggested for the basic security tasks of tamper sensitive key storage or system identification, but also for more complex cryptographic protocols like oblivious transfer (OT), bit commitment (BC), or key exchange (KE). In these works, so-called ""Strong PUFs"" are regarded as a new, fundamental cryptographic primitive of their own, comparable to the bounded storage model, quantum cryptography, or noisebased cryptography. This paper continues this line of research, investigating the correct adversarial attack model and the actual security of such protocols. In its first part, we define and compare different attack models. They reach from a clean, first setting termed the ""stand-alone, good PUF model"" to stronger scenarios like the ""bad PUF model"" and the ""PUF re-use model"". We argue why these attack models are realistic, and that existing protocols would be faced with them if used in practice. In the second part, we execute exemplary security analyses of existing schemes in the new attack models. The evaluated protocols include recent schemes from Brzuska et al. published at Crypto 2011 [1] and from Ostrovsky et al. [18]. While a number of protocols are certainly secure in their own, original attack models, the security of none of the considered protocols for OT, BC, or KE is maintained in all of the new, realistic scenarios. One consequence of our work is that the design of advanced cryptographic PUF protocols needs to be strongly reconsidered. Furthermore, it suggests that Strong PUFs require additional hardware properties in order to be broadly usable in such protocols: Firstly, they should ideally be ""erasable"", meaning that single PUF-responses can be erased without affecting other responses. If the area efficient implementation of this feature turns out to be difficult, new forms of Controlled PUFs [8] (such as Logically Erasable and Logically Reconfigurable PUFs [13]) may suffice in certain applications. Secondly, PUFs should be ""certifiable"", meaning that one can verify that the PUF has been produced faithfully and has not been manipulated in any way afterwards. The combined implementation of these features represents a pressing and challenging problem, which we pose to the PUF hardware community in this work.","cryptographic protocols, PUF-based scheme, physical unclonable function, security protocol, security evaluation, cryptographic protocol, oblivious transfer protocol, OT protocol, bit commitment protocol, BC protocol, key exchange protocol, KE protocol, cryptographic primitive, bounded storage model, quantum cryptography, noise-based cryptography, adversarial attack model, good PUF model, bad PUF model, PUF reuse model, controlled PUF, Protocols, Cryptography, Biological system modeling, Computational modeling, Hardware, Adaptation models, (Strong) Physical Unclonable Functions, (Strong) PUFs, Attack Models, Oblivious Transfer, Bit Commitment, Key Exchange, Erasable PUFs, Certifiable PUFs,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,SoK: Secure Data Deletion,"Secure data deletion is the task of deleting data irrecoverably from a physical medium. In the digital world, data is not securely deleted by default; instead, many approaches add secure deletion to existing physical medium interfaces. Interfaces to the physical medium exist at different layers, such as user-level applications, the file system, the device driver, etc. Depending on which interface is used, the properties of an approach can differ significantly. In this paper, we survey the related work in detail and organize existing approaches in terms of their interfaces to physical media. We further present a taxonomy of adversaries differing in their capabilities as well as a systematization for the characteristics of secure deletion approaches. Characteristics include environmental assumptions, such as how the interface's use affects the physical medium, as well as behavioural properties of the approach such as the deletion latency and physical wear. We perform experiments to test a selection of approaches on a variety of file systems and analyze the assumptions made in practice.","security of data, secure data deletion, digital world, physical medium interface, adversaries taxonomy, secure deletion approach, environmental assumption, deletion latency, physical wear, Media, Ash, Databases, Cryptography, Hardware, File systems, Secure deletion, Flash memory, Magnetic memory, File systems,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Anon-Pass: Practical Anonymous Subscriptions,"We present the design, security proof, and implementation of an anonymous subscription service. Users register for the service by providing some form of identity, which might or might not be linked to a real-world identity such as a credit card, a web login, or a public key. A user logs on to the system by presenting a credential derived from information received at registration. Each credential allows only a single login in any authentication window, or epoch. Logins are anonymous in the sense that the service cannot distinguish which user is logging in any better than random guessing. This implies unlinkability of a user across different logins. We find that a central tension in an anonymous subscription service is the service provider's desire for a long epoch (to reduce server-side computation) versus users' desire for a short epoch (so they can repeatedly ""re-anonymize"" their sessions). We balance this tension by having short epochs, but adding an efficient operation for clients who do not need unlinkability to cheaply re-authenticate themselves for the next time period. We measure performance of a research prototype of our protocol that allows an independent service to offer anonymous access to existing services. We implement a music service, an Android-based subway-pass application, and a web proxy, and show that adding anonymity adds minimal client latency and only requires 33 KB of server memory per active user.","mobile computing, music, operating systems (computers), security of data, client latency, Web proxy, Android-based subway-pass application, music service, user login, authentication window, anonymous subscription service, Anon-Pass application, Servers, Protocols, Subscriptions, Public key, Streaming media, Couplings, Anonymous Subscriptions,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Privacy-Preserving Ridge Regression on Hundreds of Millions of Records,"Ridge regression is an algorithm that takes as input a large number of data points and finds the best-fit linear curve through these points. The algorithm is a building block for many machine-learning operations. We present a system for privacy-preserving ridge regression. The system outputs the best-fit curve in the clear, but exposes no other information about the input data. Our approach combines both homomorphic encryption and Yao garbled circuits, where each is used in a different part of the algorithm to obtain the best performance. We implement the complete system and experiment with it on real data-sets, and show that it significantly outperforms pure implementations based only on homomorphic encryption or Yao circuits.","cryptography, data privacy, learning (artificial intelligence), privacy-preserving ridge regression, best-fit linear curve, machine learning operation, homomorphic encryption, Yao garbled circuits, Encryption, Protocols, Vectors, Integrated circuit modeling, Data models, Prediction algorithms,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,A Scanner Darkly: Protecting User Privacy from Perceptual Applications,"Perceptual, ""context-aware"" applications that observe their environment and interact with users via cameras and other sensors are becoming ubiquitous on personal computers, mobile phones, gaming platforms, household robots, and augmented-reality devices. This raises new privacy risks. We describe the design and implementation of DARKLY, a practical privacy protection system for the increasingly common scenario where an untrusted, third-party perceptual application is running on a trusted device. DARKLY is integrated with OpenCV, a popular computer vision library used by such applications to access visual inputs. It deploys multiple privacy protection mechanisms, including access control, algorithmic privacy transforms, and user audit. We evaluate DARKLY on 20 perceptual applications that perform diverse tasks such as image recognition, object tracking, security surveillance, and face detection. These applications run on DARKLY unmodified or with very few modifications and minimal performance overheads vs. native OpenCV. In most cases, privacy enforcement does not reduce the applications' functionality or accuracy. For the rest, we quantify the tradeoff between privacy and utility and demonstrate that utility remains acceptable even with strong privacy protection.","computer vision, data privacy, image scanners, ubiquitous computing, user privacy protection, third-party perceptual application, context-aware applications, privacy risks, scanner DARKLY, practical privacy protection system, OpenCV, computer vision library, multiple privacy protection mechanisms, utility, Privacy, Face, Transforms, Robots, Cameras, Libraries, Sensors, Computer vision, Privacy,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Caveat Coercitor: Coercion-Evidence in Electronic Voting,"The balance between coercion-resistance, election verifiability and usability remains unresolved in remote electronic voting despite significant research over the last few years. We propose a change of perspective, replacing the requirement of coercion-resistance with a new requirement of coercion-evidence: there should be public evidence of the amount of coercion that has taken place during a particular execution of the voting system. We provide a formal definition of coercion-evidence that has two parts. Firstly, there should be a coercion-evidence test that can be performed against the bulletin board to accurately determine the degree of coercion that has taken place in any given run. Secondly, we require coercer independence, that is the ability of the voter to follow the protocol without being detected by the coercer. To show how coercion-evidence can be achieved, we propose a new remote voting scheme, Caveat Coercitor, and we prove that it satisfies coercion-evidence. Moreover, Caveat Coercitor makes weaker trust assumptions than other remote voting systems, such as JCJ/Civitas and Helios, and has better usability properties.","government data processing, security of data, caveat coercitor scheme, coercion evidence, electronic voting, coercion resistance, election verifiability, election usability, coercer independence, Helios system, JCJ-Civitas system, Nominations and elections, Protocols, Encryption, Electronic voting, Usability, Coercion resistance, coercion evidence, electronic voting, verifiable elections, security protocols, security models, usability,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,SoK: The Evolution of Sybil Defense via Social Networks,"Sybil attacks in which an adversary forges a potentially unbounded number of identities are a danger to distributed systems and online social networks. The goal of sybil defense is to accurately identify sybil identities. This paper surveys the evolution of sybil defense protocols that leverage the structural properties of the social graph underlying a distributed system to identify sybil identities. We make two main contributions. First, we clarify the deep connection between sybil defense and the theory of random walks. This leads us to identify a community detection algorithm that, for the first time, offers provable guarantees in the context of sybil defense. Second, we advocate a new goal for sybil defense that addresses the more limited, but practically useful, goal of securely white-listing a local region of the graph.","security of data, social networking (online), SoK framework, social network, sybil defense protocol, sybil identity, random walks theory, community detection algorithm, graph white-listing, Protocols, Communities, Image edge detection, Facebook, Robustness, Detection algorithms,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Zerocoin: Anonymous Distributed E-Cash from Bitcoin,"Bitcoin is the first e-cash system to see widespread adoption. While Bitcoin offers the potential for new types of financial interaction, it has significant limitations regarding privacy. Specifically, because the Bitcoin transaction log is completely public, users' privacy is protected only through the use of pseudonyms. In this paper we propose Zerocoin, a cryptographic extension to Bitcoin that augments the protocol to allow for fully anonymous currency transactions. Our system uses standard cryptographic assumptions and does not introduce new trusted parties or otherwise change the security model of Bitcoin. We detail Zerocoin's cryptographic construction, its integration into Bitcoin, and examine its performance both in terms of computation and impact on the Bitcoin protocol.","cryptography, data privacy, electronic money, Zerocoin cryptographic construction, anonymous distributed e-cash, Bitcoin protocol, financial interaction, user privacy, pseudonym, cryptographic extension, anonymous currency transactions, standard cryptographic assumptions, Online banking, Protocols, Cryptography, Privacy, Peer-to-peer computing, Concrete,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,seL4: From General Purpose to a Proof of Information Flow Enforcement,"In contrast to testing, mathematical reasoning and formal verification can show the absence of whole classes of security vulnerabilities. We present the, to our knowledge, first complete, formal, machine-checked verification of information flow security for the implementation of a general-purpose microkernel; namely seL4. Unlike previous proofs of information flow security for operating system kernels, ours applies to the actual 8, 830 lines of C code that implement seL4, and so rules out the possibility of invalidation by implementation errors in this code. We assume correctness of compiler, assembly code, hardware, and boot code. We prove everything else. This proof is strong evidence of seL4's utility as a separation kernel, and describes precisely how the general purpose kernel should be configured to enforce isolation and mandatory information flow control. We describe the information flow security statement we proved (a variant of intransitive noninterference), including the assumptions on which it rests, as well as the modifications that had to be made to seL4 to ensure it was enforced. We discuss the practical limitations and implications of this result, including covert channels not covered by the formal proof.","formal verification, inference mechanisms, operating system kernels, program compilers, security of data, seL4 general-purpose microkernel, information flow enforcement, mathematical reasoning, formal verification, security vulnerability, machine-checked verification, information flow security, compiler, assembly code, hardware, boot code, separation kernel, Kernel, Access control, Message systems, Hardware, Abstracts, Silicon, information flow control, formal verification,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,"Design, Implementation and Verification of an eXtensible and Modular Hypervisor Framework","We present the design, implementation, and verification of XMHF- an eXtensible and Modular Hypervisor Framework. XMHF is designed to achieve three goals -- modular extensibility, automated verification, and high performance. XMHF includes a core that provides functionality common to many hypervisor-based security architectures and supports extensions that augment the core with additional security or functional properties while preserving the fundamental hypervisor security property of memory integrity (i.e., ensuring that the hypervisor's memory is not modified by software running at a lower privilege level). We verify the memory integrity of the XMHF core -- 6018 lines of code -- using a combination of automated and manual techniques. The model checker CBMC automatically verifies 5208 lines of C code in about 80 seconds using less than 2GB of RAM. We manually audit the remaining 422 lines of C code and 388 lines of assembly language code that are stable and unlikely to change as development proceeds. Our experiments indicate that XMHF's performance is comparable to popular high-performance general-purpose hypervisors for the single guest that it supports.","assembly language, design engineering, formal verification, security of data, virtual machines, extensible and modular hypervisor framework design, extensible and modular hypervisor framework implementation, extensible and modular hypervisor framework verification, XMHF core, modular extensibility, automated verification, high-performance general-purpose hypervisors, hypervisor-based security architectures, fundamental hypervisor security property, memory integrity, model checker CBMC, C code, assembly language code, time 80 s, Virtual machine monitors, Hardware, Security, Performance evaluation, Computer architecture, Software, Virtualization, Hypervisor Framework, Memory Integrity, Verification, Hypervisor Applications (""Hypapps""),"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Implementing TLS with Verified Cryptographic Security,"TLS is possibly the most used protocol for secure communications, with a 18-year history of flaws and fixes, ranging from its protocol logic to its cryptographic design, and from the Internet standard to its diverse implementations. We develop a verified reference implementation of TLS 1.2. Our code fully supports its wire formats, ciphersuites, sessions and connections, re-handshakes and resumptions, alerts and errors, and data fragmentation, as prescribed in the RFCs; it interoperates with mainstream web browsers and servers. At the same time, our code is carefully structured to enable its modular, automated verification, from its main API down to computational assumptions on its cryptographic algorithms. Our implementation is written in F# and specified in F7. We present security specifications for its main components, such as authenticated stream encryption for the record layer and key establishment for the handshake. We describe their verification using the F7 typechecker. To this end, we equip each cryptographic primitive and construction of TLS with a new typed interface that captures its security properties, and we gradually replace concrete implementations with ideal functionalities. We finally typecheck the protocol state machine, and obtain precise security theorems for TLS, as it is implemented and deployed. We also revisit classic attacks and report a few new ones.","application program interfaces, computer network security, cryptographic protocols, file servers, formal specification, Internet, online front-ends, TLS 1.2, verified cryptographic security, protocol logic, cryptographic design, Internet standard, wire formats, ciphersuites, sessions, connections, re-handshakes, resumption, alerts, errors, data fragmentation, RFC, mainstream Web browser, Web servers, API, F#, F7 typechecker, security specifications, authenticated stream encryption, record layer, key establishment, typed interface, protocol state machine, classic attacks, transport layer security, time 18 year, Protocols, Servers, Standards, Encryption, Libraries, Transport Layer Security, Security Protocol Implementation, Formal Verification, Provable Security,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,An Ideal-Security Protocol for Order-Preserving Encoding,"Order-preserving encryption - an encryption scheme where the sort order of ciphertexts matches the sort order of the corresponding plaintexts - allows databases and other applications to process queries involving order over encrypted data efficiently. The ideal security guarantee for order-preserving encryption put forth in the literature is for the ciphertexts to reveal no information about the plaintexts besides order. Even though more than a dozen schemes were proposed, all these schemes leak more information than order. This paper presents the first order-preserving scheme that achieves ideal security. Our main technique is mutable ciphertexts, meaning that over time, the ciphertexts for a small number of plaintext values change, and we prove that mutable ciphertexts are needed for ideal security. Our resulting protocol is interactive, with a small number of interactions. We implemented our scheme and evaluated it on microbenchmarks and in the context of an encrypted MySQL database application. We show that in addition to providing ideal security, our scheme achieves 1 - 2 orders of magnitude higher performance than the state-of-the-art order-preserving encryption scheme, which is less secure than our scheme.","cryptographic protocols, encoding, query processing, SQL, ideal-security protocol, order-preserving encoding, order-preserving encryption, mutable ciphertexts, plaintexts, encrypted MySQL database application, query processing, first order-preserving scheme, microbenchmarks, Encoding, Servers, Encryption, Vegetation, Protocols, order-preserving encryption, encoding,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Efficient Garbling from a Fixed-Key Blockcipher,"We advocate schemes based on fixed-key AES as the best route to highly efficient circuit-garbling. We provide such schemes making only one AES call per garbled-gate evaluation. On the theoretical side, we justify the security of these methods in the random-permutation model, where parties have access to a public random permutation. On the practical side, we provide the Just Garble system, which implements our schemes.

IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Circuit Structures for Improving Efficiency of Security and Privacy Tools,"Several techniques in computer security, including generic protocols for secure computation and symbolic execution, depend on implementing algorithms in static circuits. Despite substantial improvements in recent years, tools built using these techniques remain too slow for most practical uses. They require transforming arbitrary programs into either Boolean logic circuits, constraint sets on Boolean variables, or other equivalent representations, and the costs of using these tools scale directly with the size of the input circuit. Hence, techniques for more efficient circuit constructions have benefits across these tools. We show efficient circuit constructions for various simple but commonly used data structures including stacks, queues, and associative maps. While current practice requires effectively copying the entire structure for each operation, our techniques take advantage of locality and batching to provide amortized costs that scale polylogarithmically in the size of the structure. We demonstrate how many common array usage patterns can be significantly improved with the help of these circuit structures. We report on experiments using our circuit structures for both generic secure computation using garbled circuits and automated test input generation using symbolic execution, and demonstrate order of magnitude improvements for both applications.","Boolean algebra, data privacy, logic circuits, circuit structures, security tools, privacy tools, computer security, generic protocols, computation security, symbolic execution, static circuits, Boolean logic circuits, Boolean variables, data structures, locality, batching, array usage patterns, garbled circuits, automated test input generation, Arrays, Protocols, Radiation detectors, Multiplexing, Logic gates, Indexes, Wires, secure computation, symbolic execution, circuits, optimization,"

Over the years, many attacks on HTTPS and the certificate trust model it uses have been hypothesized, executed, and/or evolved. Meanwhile the number of browser-trusted (and thus, de facto, user-trusted) certificate authorities has proliferated, while the due diligence in baseline certificate issuance has declined. We survey and categorize prominent security issues with HTTPS and provide a systematic treatment of the history and on-going challenges, intending to provide context for future directions. We also provide a comparative evaluation of current proposals for enhancing the certificate infrastructure used in practice.","Internet, online front-ends, security of data, transport protocols, SoK, SSL, HTTPS, certificate trust model enhancements, Internet users, browser-trusted certificate authority, baseline certificate issuance, Browsers, Protocols, Servers, Cryptography, Organizations, Software, SSL, certificates, browser trust model, usability,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Lucky Thirteen: Breaking the TLS and DTLS Record Protocols,"The Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol aims to provide confidentiality and integrity of data in transit across untrusted networks. TLS has become the de facto secure protocol of choice for Internet and mobile applications. DTLS is a variant of TLS that is growing in importance. In this paper, we present distinguishing and plaintext recovery attacks against TLS and DTLS. The attacks are based on a delicate timing analysis of decryption processing in the two protocols. We include experimental results demonstrating the feasibility of the attacks in realistic network environments for several different implementations of TLS and DTLS, including the leading OpenSSL implementations. We provide countermeasures for the attacks. Finally, we discuss the wider implications of our attacks for the cryptographic design used by TLS and DTLS.","computer network security, cryptographic protocols, data integrity, Internet, mobile computing, DTLS record protocols, transport layer security protocol, data confidentiality, data integrity, de facto secure protocol, Internet, mobile applications, plaintext recovery attacks, timing analysis, decryption, OpenSSL implementations, cryptographic design, Timing, Encryption, Ciphers, Media Access Protocol, TLS, DTLS, CBC-mode encryption, timing attack, plaintext recovery,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Cookieless Monster: Exploring the Ecosystem of Web-Based Device Fingerprinting,"The web has become an essential part of our society and is currently the main medium of information delivery. Billions of users browse the web on a daily basis, and there are single websites that have reached over one billion user accounts. In this environment, the ability to track users and their online habits can be very lucrative for advertising companies, yet very intrusive for the privacy of users. In this paper, we examine how web-based device fingerprinting currently works on the Internet. By analyzing the code of three popular browser-fingerprinting code providers, we reveal the techniques that allow websites to track users without the need of client-side identifiers. Among these techniques, we show how current commercial fingerprinting approaches use questionable practices, such as the circumvention of HTTP proxies to discover a user's real IP address and the installation of intrusive browser plugins. At the same time, we show how fragile the browser ecosystem is against fingerprinting through the use of novel browser-identifying techniques. With so many different vendors involved in browser development, we demonstrate how one can use diversions in the browsers' implementation to distinguish successfully not only the browser-family, but also specific major and minor versions. Browser extensions that help users spoof the user-agent of their browsers are also evaluated. We show that current commercial approaches can bypass the extensions, and, in addition, take advantage of their shortcomings by using them as additional fingerprinting features.","data privacy, Internet, online front-ends, Web sites, cookieless monster, Web-based device fingerprinting ecosystem, information delivery, Websites, user privacy, Internet, browser-fingerprinting code providers, IP address, intrusive browser plugins, browser-identifying techniques, user-agent, Browsers, Companies, IP networks, Fingerprint recognition, Servers, Internet, Feature extraction, fingerprinting, device identification, browser extensions,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Practical Control Flow Integrity and Randomization for Binary Executables,"Control Flow Integrity (CFI) provides a strong protection against modern control-flow hijacking attacks. However, performance and compatibility issues limit its adoption. We propose a new practical and realistic protection method called CCFIR (Compact Control Flow Integrity and Randomization), which addresses the main barriers to CFI adoption. CCFIR collects all legal targets of indirect control-transfer instructions, puts them into a dedicated ""Springboard section"" in a random order, and then limits indirect transfers to flow only to them. Using the Springboard section for targets, CCFIR can validate a target more simply and faster than traditional CFI, and provide support for on-site target-randomization as well as better compatibility. Based on these approaches, CCFIR can stop control-flow hijacking attacks including ROP and return-into-libc. Results show that ROP gadgets are all eliminated. We observe that with the wide deployment of ASLR, Windows/x86 PE executables contain enough information in relocation tables which CCFIR can use to find all legal instructions and jump targets reliably, without source code or symbol information. We evaluate our prototype implementation on common web browsers and the SPEC CPU2000 suite: CCFIR protects large applications such as GCC and Firefox completely automatically, and has low performance overhead of about 3.6%/8.6% (average/max) using SPECint2000. Experiments on real-world exploits also show that CCFIR-hardened versions of IE6, Firefox 3.6 and other applications are protected effectively.","computer crime, legislation, online front-ends, Web sites, binary executable, control-flow hijacking attack protection, protection method, CCFIR, compact control flow integrity and randomization, CFI adoption, control-transfer instruction, springboard section, on-site target-randomization, ROP, return-into-libc, ASLR, Windows/x86 PE, legal instruction, Web browser, SPEC CPU2000, GCC, Firefox, Security, Layout, Libraries, Runtime, Law, Control systems,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Just-In-Time Code Reuse: On the Effectiveness of Fine-Grained Address Space Layout Randomization,"Fine-grained address space layout randomization (ASLR) has recently been proposed as a method of efficiently mitigating runtime attacks. In this paper, we introduce the design and implementation of a framework based on a novel attack strategy, dubbed just-in-time code reuse, that undermines the benefits of fine-grained ASLR. Specifically, we derail the assumptions embodied in fine-grained ASLR by exploiting the ability to repeatedly abuse a memory disclosure to map an application's memory layout on-the-fly, dynamically discover API functions and gadgets, and JIT-compile a target program using those gadgets -- all within a script environment at the time an exploit is launched. We demonstrate the power of our framework by using it in conjunction with a real-world exploit against Internet Explorer, and also provide extensive evaluations that demonstrate the practicality of just-in-time code reuse attacks. Our findings suggest that fine-grained ASLR may not be as promising as first thought.","application program interfaces, program compilers, search engines, security of data, just-in-time code reuse attacks, fine-grained address space layout randomization, ASLR, runtime attacks, attack strategy, memory disclosure, API functions, API gadgets, JIT-compile, script environment, Internet Explorer, Runtime, Layout, Libraries, Payloads, Registers, Security, Programming,"
IEEE Security and Privacy 2013,Welcome to the Entropics: Boot-Time Entropy in Embedded Devices,"We present three techniques for extracting entropy during boot on embedded devices. Our first technique times the execution of code blocks early in the Linux kernel boot process. It is simple to implement and has a negligible runtime overhead, but, on many of the devices we test, gathers hundreds of bits of entropy. Our second and third techniques, which run in the bootloader, use hardware features - DRAM decay behavior and PLL locking latency, respectively -- and are therefore less portable and less generally applicable, but their behavior is easier to explain based on physically unpredictable processes. We implement and measure the effectiveness of our techniques on ARM-, MIPS-, and AVR32-based systems-on-a-chip from a variety of vendors.","DRAM chips, embedded systems, entropy, Linux, microprocessor chips, operating system kernels, phase locked loops, system-on-chip, entropics, boot-time entropy, embedded devices, entropy extraction, code block execution, Linux kernel boot process, bootloader, DRAM decay behavior, PLL locking latency, ARM based systems-on-a-chip, MIPS-based systems-on-a-chip, AVR32-based systems-on-a-chip, phase-locked loops, Entropy, Kernel, Linux, Instruments, System-on-chip, Random access memory, Timing, entropy, randomness, embedded devices, dram, pll, timing,"

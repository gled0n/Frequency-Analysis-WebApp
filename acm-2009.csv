ACM CCS 2009,Attacking cryptographic schemes based on &quot;perturbation polynomials&quot;.,"We show attacks on several cryptographic schemes that have recently been proposed for achieving various security goals in sensor networks. Roughly speaking, these schemes all use ""perturbation polynomials"" to add ""noise"" to polynomialbased systems that offer information-theoretic security, in an attempt to increase the resilience threshold while maintaining efficiency. We show that the heuristic security arguments given for these modified schemes do not hold, and that they can be completely broken once we allow even a slight extension of the parameters beyond those achieved by the underlying information-theoretic schemes."
ACM CCS 2009,On achieving good operating points on an ROC plane using stochastic anomaly score prediction.,"ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we argue that a real-time IDS' input changes considerably over time and ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve. To address this problem, we propose a simple, generic and adaptive technique to achieve good ROC operating points for any given IDS. The proposed technique stochastically predicts the next anomaly score of an IDS and the anomaly classification threshold is then set as a function of the predicted score. We first perform statistical and information-theoretic analyses of network- and host-based IDSs' anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains and then use this model to predict and adapt an IDS' classification threshold. The proposed adaptive thresholding module is incorporated into six prominent network- and host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs). These adaptive ADSs are evaluated on public and labeled attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need for manual threshold configuration and having very low-complexity, adaptive thresholding enables the ADSs to achieve considerably higher accuracies on the ROC plane."
ACM CCS 2009,CoSP - a general framework for computational soundness proofs.,"We describe CoSP, a general framework for conducting computational soundness proofs of symbolic models and for embedding these proofs into formal calculi. CoSP considers arbitrary equational theories and computational implementations, and it abstracts away many details that are not crucial for proving computational soundness, such as message scheduling, corruption models, and even the internal structure of a protocol. CoSP enables soundness results, in the sense of preservation of trace properties, to be proven in a conceptually modular and generic way: proving x cryptographic primitives sound for y calculi only requires x + y proofs (instead of x • y proofs without this framework), and the process of embedding calculi is conceptually decoupled from computational soundness proofs of cryptographic primitives. We exemplify the usefulness of CoSP by proving the first computational soundness result for the full-fledged applied π-calculus under active attacks. Concretely, we embed the applied π-calculus into CoSP and give a sound implementation of public-key encryption and digital signatures."
ACM CCS 2009,An efficient forward private RFID protocol.,"Radio Frequency IDentifiers (RFID) are low-cost pervasive devices used in various settings for identification purposes: although they have originally been introduced to ease the supply chain management, they are already used in many other applications. Some of these applications need secure identification and ad-hoc authentication protocols have to be designed for that purpose. But the intrusion of RFID in the life of end-users might additionally require a higher level of user-privacy. Such security and privacy requirements conflict with the highly constrained environment of RFID systems. Ohkubo, Suzuki, and Kinoshita first proposed an appealing RFID protocol that meets the highest privacy requirements. However, their scheme and its known variants suffer from limitations in terms of computational complexity and provable security which this paper aims to address. We propose a novel forward private authentication scheme built upon less computationally expensive cryptographic ingredients, namely pseudo-random generators and universal hash functions instead of one way hash functions. In contrast with existing schemes, we provide security proofs of our construction in the standard model instead of the random oracle model."
ACM CCS 2009,Anonymous credentials on a standard java card.,"Secure identity tokens such as Electronic Identity (eID) cards are emerging everywhere. At the same time user-centric identity management gains acceptance. Anonymous credential schemes are the optimal realization of user-centricity. However, on inexpensive hardware platforms, typically used for eID cards, these schemes could not be made to meet the necessary requirements such as future-proof key lengths and transaction times on the order of 10 seconds. The reasons for this is the need for the hardware platform to be standardized and certified. Therefore an implementation is only possible as a Java Card applet. This results in severe restrictions: little memory (transient and persistent), an 8-bit CPU, and access to hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations only by defined interfaces such as RSA encryption operations."
ACM CCS 2009,Reactive noninterference.,"Many programs operate reactively--patiently waiting for user input, running for a while producing output, and eventually returning to a state where they are ready to accept another input (or occasionally diverging). When a reactive program communicates with multiple parties, we would like to be sure that it can be given secret information by one without leaking it to others."
ACM CCS 2009,XCS - cross channel scripting and its impact on web applications.,"We study the security of embedded web servers used in consumer electronic devices, such as security cameras and photo frames, and for IT infrastructure, such as wireless access points and lights-out management systems. All the devices we examine turn out to be vulnerable to a variety of web attacks, including cross site scripting (XSS) and cross site request forgery (CSRF). In addition, we show that consumer electronics are particularly vulnerable to a nasty form of persistent XSS where a non-web channel such as NFS or SNMP is used to inject a malicious script. This script is later used to attack an unsuspecting user who connects to the device's web server. We refer to web attacks which are mounted through a non-web channel as cross channel scripting (XCS). We propose a client-side defense against certain XCS which we implement as a browser extension."
ACM CCS 2009,HAIL - a high-availability and integrity layer for cloud storage.,"We introduce HAIL (High-Availability and Integrity Layer), a distributed cryptographic system that allows a set of servers to prove to a client that a stored file is intact and retrievable. HAIL strengthens, formally unifies, and streamlines distinct approaches from the cryptographic and distributed-systems communities. Proofs in HAIL are efficiently computable by servers and highly compact---typically tens or hundreds of bytes, irrespective of file size. HAIL cryptographically verifies and reactively reallocates file shares. It is robust against an active, mobile adversary, i.e., one that may progressively corrupt the full set of servers. We propose a strong, formal adversarial model for HAIL, and rigorous analysis and parameter choices. We show how HAIL improves on the security and efficiency of existing tools, like Proofs of Retrievability (PORs) deployed on individual servers. We also report on a prototype implementation."
ACM CCS 2009,Dispatcher - enabling active botnet infiltration using automatic protocol reverse-engineering.,"Automatic protocol reverse-engineering is important for many security applications, including the analysis and defense against botnets. Understanding the command-and-control (C&C) protocol used by a botnet is crucial for anticipating its repertoire of nefarious activity and to enable active botnet infiltration. Frequently, security analysts need to rewrite messages sent and received by a bot in order to contain malicious activity and to provide the botmaster with an illusion of successful and unhampered operation. To enable such rewriting, we need detailed information about the intent and structure of the messages in both directions of the communication despite the fact that we generally only have access to the implementation of one endpoint, namely the bot binary. Current techniques cannot enable such rewriting. In this paper, we propose techniques to extract the format of protocol messages sent by an application that implements a protocol specification, and to infer the field semantics for messages both sent and received by the application. Our techniques enable applications such as rewriting the C&C messages for active botnet infiltration. We implement our techniques into Dispatcher, a tool to extract the message format and field semantics of both received and sent messages. We use Dispatcher to analyze MegaD, a prevalent spam botnet employing a hitherto undocumented C&C protocol, and show that the protocol information extracted by Dispatcher can be used to rewrite the C&C messages."
ACM CCS 2009,Oblivious transfer with access control.,"We present a protocol for anonymous access to a database where the different records have different access control permissions. These permissions could be attributes, roles, or rights that the user needs to have in order to access the record. Our protocol offers maximal security guarantees for both the database and the user, namely (1) only authorized users can access the record; (2) the database provider does not learn which record the user accesses; and (3) the database provider does not learn which attributes or roles the user has when she accesses the database."
ACM CCS 2009,Mapping kernel objects to enable systematic integrity checking.,"Dynamic kernel data have become an attractive target for kernel-mode malware. However, previous solutions for checking kernel integrity either limit themselves to code and static data or can only inspect a fraction of dynamic data, resulting in limited protection. Our study shows that previous solutions may reach only 28% of the dynamic kernel data and thus may fail to identify function pointers manipulated by many kernel-mode malware."
ACM CCS 2009,On the difficulty of software-based attestation of embedded devices.,"Device attestation is an essential feature in many security protocols and applications. The lack of dedicated hardware and the impossibility to physically access devices to be attested, makes attestation of embedded devices, in applications such as Wireless Sensor Networks, a prominent challenge. Several software-based attestation techniques have been proposed that either rely on tight time constraints or on the lack of free space to store malicious code. This paper investigates the shortcomings of existing software-based attestation techniques. We first present two generic attacks, one based on a return-oriented rootkit} and the other on code compression. We further describe specific attacks on two existing proposals, namely SWATT and ICE-based schemes, and argue about the difficulty of fixing them. All attacks presented in this paper were implemented and validated on commodity sensors."
ACM CCS 2009,Certificateless onion routing.,"Onion routing protocols allow users to establish anonymous channels to preserve their privacy over a public network. Several protocols implementing this primitive have been proposed in recent years, and TOR, a real-life implementation, provides an onion routing service to thousands of users over the internet."
ACM CCS 2009,Improving privacy and security in multi-authority attribute-based encryption.,"Attribute based encryption (ABE) [13] determines decryption ability based on a user's attributes. In a multi-authority ABE scheme, multiple attribute-authorities monitor different sets of attributes and issue corresponding decryption keys to users, and encryptors can require that a user obtain keys for appropriate attributes from each authority before decrypting a message. Chase [5] gave a multi-authority ABE scheme using the concepts of a trusted central authority (CA) and global identifiers (GID). However, the CA in that construction has the power to decrypt every ciphertext, which seems somehow contradictory to the original goal of distributing control over many potentially untrusted authorities. Moreover, in that construction, the use of a consistent GID allowed the authorities to combine their information to build a full profile with all of a user's attributes, which unnecessarily compromises the privacy of the user. In this paper, we propose a solution which removes the trusted central authority, and protects the users' privacy by preventing the authorities from pooling their information on particular users, thus making ABE more usable in practice."
ACM CCS 2009,Multiple password interference in text passwords and click-based graphical passwords.,"The underlying issues relating to the usability and security of multiple passwords are largely unexplored. However, we know that people generally have difficulty remembering multiple passwords. This reduces security since users reuse the same password for different systems or reveal other passwords as they try to log in. We report on a laboratory study comparing recall of multiple text passwords with recall of multiple click-based graphical passwords. In a one-hour session (short-term), we found that participants in the graphical password condition coped significantly better than those in the text password condition. In particular, they made fewer errors when recalling their passwords, did not resort to creating passwords directly related to account names, and did not use similar passwords across multiple accounts. After two weeks, participants in the two conditions had recall success rates that were not statistically different from each other, but those with text passwords made more recall errors than participants with graphical passwords. In our study, click-based graphical passwords were significantly less susceptible to multiple password interference in the short-term, while having comparable usability to text passwords in most other respects."
ACM CCS 2009,Robust signatures for kernel data structures.,"Kernel-mode rootkits hide objects such as processes and threads using a technique known as Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM). Many forensic analysis tools attempt to detect these hidden objects by scanning kernel memory with handmade signatures; however, such signatures are brittle and rely on non-essential features of these data structures, making them easy to evade. In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for generating signatures for kernel data structures and show that these signatures are robust: attempts to evade the signature by modifying the structure contents will cause the OS to consider the object invalid. Using dynamic analysis, we profile the target data structure to determine commonly used fields, and we then fuzz those fields to determine which are essential to the correct operation of the OS. These fields form the basis of a signature for the data structure. In our experiments, our new signature matched the accuracy of existing scanners for traditional malware and found processes hidden with our prototype rootkit that all current signatures missed. Our techniques significantly increase the difficulty of hiding objects from signature scanning."
ACM CCS 2009,As-awareness in Tor path selection.,"Tor is an anonymous communications network with thousands of router nodes worldwide. An intuition reflected in much of the literature on anonymous communications is that, as an anonymity network grows, it becomes more secure against a given observer because the observer will see less of the network. In particular, as the Tor network grows from volunteers operating relays all over the world, it becomes less and less likely for a single autonomous system (AS) to be able to observe both ends of an anonymous connection. Yet, as the network continues to grow significantly, no analysis has been done to determine if this intuition is correct. Further, modifications to Tor's path selection algorithm to help clients avoid an AS-level observer have not been proposed and analyzed."
ACM CCS 2009,On lightweight mobile phone application certification.,"Users have begun downloading an increasingly large number of mobile phone applications in response to advancements in handsets and wireless networks. The increased number of applications results in a greater chance of installing Trojans and similar malware. In this paper, we propose the Kirin security service for Android, which performs lightweight certification of applications to mitigate malware at install time. Kirin certification uses security rules, which are templates designed to conservatively match undesirable properties in security configuration bundled with applications. We use a variant of security requirements engineering techniques to perform an in-depth security analysis of Android to produce a set of rules that match malware characteristics. In a sample of 311 of the most popular applications downloaded from the official Android Market, Kirin and our rules found 5 applications that implement dangerous functionality and therefore should be installed with extreme caution. Upon close inspection, another five applications asserted dangerous rights, but were within the scope of reasonable functional needs. These results indicate that security configuration bundled with Android applications provides practical means of detecting malware."
ACM CCS 2009,Dynamic provable data possession.,"We consider the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files."
ACM CCS 2009,A security-preserving compiler for distributed programs - from information-flow policies to cryptographic mechanisms.,"We enforce information flow policies in programs that run at multiple locations, with diverse levels of security."
ACM CCS 2009,A probabilistic approach to hybrid role mining.,"Role mining algorithms address an important access control problem: configuring a role-based access control system. Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role mining discovers a set of roles together with an assignment of users to roles. The results should closely agree with the direct assignment. Moreover, the roles should be understandable from the business perspective in that they reflect functional roles within the enterprise. This requires hybrid role mining methods that work with both direct assignments and business information from the enterprise."
ACM CCS 2009,On non-cooperative location privacy - a game-theoretic analysis.,"In mobile networks, authentication is a required primitive for the majority of security protocols. However, an adversary can track the location of mobile nodes by monitoring pseudonyms used for authentication. A frequently proposed solution to protect location privacy suggests that mobile nodes collectively change their pseudonyms in regions called mix zones. Because this approach is costly, self-interested mobile nodes might decide not to cooperate and could thus jeopardize the achievable location privacy. In this paper, we analyze the non-cooperative behavior of mobile nodes by using a game-theoretic model, where each player aims at maximizing its location privacy at a minimum cost. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in n-player complete information games. Because mobile nodes in a privacy-sensitive system do not know their opponents' payoffs, we then consider incomplete information games. We establish that symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibria exist with simple threshold strategies in n-player games and derive the equilibrium strategies. By means of numerical results, we show that mobile nodes become selfish when the cost of changing pseudonyms is small, whereas they cooperate more when the cost of changing pseudonyms increases. Finally, we design a protocol - the PseudoGame protocol - based on the results of our analysis."
ACM CCS 2009,Battle of Botcraft - fighting bots in online games with human observational proofs.,"The abuse of online games by automated programs, known as game bots, for gaining unfair advantages has plagued millions of participating players with escalating severity in recent years. The current methods for distinguishing bots and humans are based on human interactive proofs (HIPs), such as CAPTCHAs. However, HIP-based approaches have inherent drawbacks. In particular, they are too obtrusive to be tolerated by human players in a gaming context. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive approach based on human observational proofs (HOPs) for continuous game bot detection. HOPs differentiate bots from human players by passively monitoring input actions that are difficult for current bots to perform in a human-like manner. We collect a series of user-input traces in one of the most popular online games, World of Warcraft. Based on the traces, we characterize the game playing behaviors of bots and humans. Then, we develop a HOP-based game bot defense system that analyzes user-input actions with a cascade-correlation neural network to distinguish bots from humans. The HOP system is effective in capturing current game bots, which raises the bar against game exploits and forces a determined adversary to build more complicated game bots for detection evasion in the future."
ACM CCS 2009,Multi-party off-the-record messaging.,"Most cryptographic algorithms provide a means for secret and authentic communication. However, under many circumstances, the ability to repudiate messages or deny a conversation is no less important than secrecy and authenticity. For whistleblowers, informants, political dissidents and journalists --- to name a few --- it is most important to have means for deniable conversation, where electronic communication must mimic face-to-face private meetings. Off-the-Record Messaging, proposed in 2004 by Borisov, Goldberg and Brewer, and its subsequent improvements, simulate private two-party meetings. Despite some attempts, the multi-party scenario remains unresolved."
ACM CCS 2009,Large-scale malware indexing using function-call graphs.,"A major challenge of the anti-virus (AV) industry is how to effectively process the huge influx of malware samples they receive every day. One possible solution to this problem is to quickly determine if a new malware sample is similar to any previously-seen malware program. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate a malware database management system called SMIT (Symantec Malware Indexing Tree) that can efficiently make such determination based on malware's function-call graphs, which is a structural representation known to be less susceptible to instruction-level obfuscations commonly employed by malware writers to evade detection of AV software. Because each malware program is represented as a graph, the problem of searching for the most similar malware program in a database to a given malware sample is cast into a nearest-neighbor search problem in a graph database. To speed up this search, we have developed an efficient method to compute graph similarity that exploits structural and instruction-level information in the underlying malware programs, and a multi-resolution indexing scheme that uses a computationally economical feature vector for early pruning and resorts to a more accurate but computationally more expensive graph similarity function only when it needs to pinpoint the most similar neighbors. Results of a comprehensive performance study of the SMIT prototype using a database of more than 100,000 malware demonstrate the effective pruning power and scalability of its nearest neighbor search mechanisms."
ACM CCS 2009,Fides - remote anomaly-based cheat detection using client emulation.,"As a result of physically owning the client machine, cheaters in online games currently have the upper-hand when it comes to avoiding detection. To address this problem and turn the table on cheaters, this paper presents Fides, an anomaly-based cheat detection approach that remotely validates game execution. With Fides, a server-side Controller specifies how and when a client-side Auditor measures the game. To accurately validate measurements, the Controller partially emulates the client and collaborates with the server. This paper examines a range of cheat methods and initial measurements that counter them, showing that a Fides prototype is able to efficiently detect several existing cheats, including one state-of-the-art cheat that is advertised as ""undetectable""."
ACM CCS 2009,"EPC RFID tag security weaknesses and defenses - passport cards, enhanced drivers licenses, and beyond.","EPC (Electronic Product Code) tags are industry-standard RFID devices poised to supplant optical barcodes in many applications. We explore the systemic risks and challenges created by the increasingly common use of EPC for security applications. As a central case study, we examine the recently issued United States Passport Card and Washington State ""enhanced drivers license"" (WA EDL), both of which incorporate Gen-2 EPC tags. We measure multiple weaknesses, including susceptibility to cloning, extended read ranges, and the ability to remotely kill a WA EDL. We study the implications of these vulnerabilities to overall system security, and offer suggestions for improvement. We demonstrate anti-cloning techniques for off-the-shelf EPC tags, overcoming practical challenges in a previous proposal to co-opt the EPC ""kill"" command to achieve tag authentication. Our paper fills a vacuum of experimentally grounded evaluation of and guidance for security applications for EPC tags not just in identity documents, but more broadly in the authentication of objects and people."
ACM CCS 2009,Computational soundness for key exchange protocols with symmetric encryption.,"Formal analysis of security protocols based on symbolic models has been very successful in finding flaws in published protocols and proving protocols secure, using automated tools. An important question is whether this kind of formal analysis implies security guarantees in the strong sense of modern cryptography. Initiated by the seminal work of Abadi and Rogaway, this question has been investigated and numerous positive results showing this so-called computational soundness of formal analysis have been obtained. However, for the case of active adversaries and protocols that use symmetric encryption computational soundness has remained a challenge."
ACM CCS 2009,Efficient pseudorandom functions from the decisional linear assumption and weaker variants.,"In this paper, we generalize Naor and Reingold's construction of pseudorandom functions under the DDH Assumption [22] to yield a construction of pseudorandom functions under the decisional k-Linear Assumption, for each k › 1. The decisional Linear Assumption was first introduced by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham in [5] as an alternative assumption for settings where the DDH problem is easy, such as bilinear groups. Shacham [25] and Hofheinz and Kiltz [16] independently introduced the generalized decisional k-Linear Assumptions and showed that the decisional (k+1)-Linear problem is hard for generic groups even when the decisional k-Linear problem is easy. It is thus desirable to have constructions of cryptographic primitives based on the decisional k-Linear Assumption instead of DDH. Not surprisingly, one must pay a small price for added security: as k increases, our constructed functions become slightly less efficient to compute and the key size increases (quadratically in k)."
ACM CCS 2009,Finding bugs in exceptional situations of JNI programs.,"Software flaws in native methods may defeat Java's guarantees of safety and security. One common kind of flaws in native methods results from the discrepancy on how exceptions are handled in Java and in native methods. Unlike exceptions in Java, exceptions raised in the native code through the Java Native Interface (JNI) are not controlled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Only after the native code finishes execution will the JVM's mechanism for exceptions take over. This discrepancy makes handling of JNI exceptions an error prone process and can cause serious security flaws in software written using the JNI."
ACM CCS 2009,A new cell counter based attack against tor.,"Various low-latency anonymous communication systems such as Tor and Anoymizer have been designed to provide anonymity service for users. In order to hide the communication of users, many anonymity systems pack the application data into equal-sized cells (e.g., 512 bytes for Tor, a known real-world, circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication network). In this paper, we investigate a new cell counter based attack against Tor, which allows the attacker to confirm anonymous communication relationship among users very quickly. In this attack, by marginally varying the counter of cells in the target traffic at the malicious exit onion router, the attacker can embed a secret signal into the variation of cell counter of the target traffic. The embedded signal will be carried along with the target traffic and arrive at the malicious entry onion router. Then an accomplice of the attacker at the malicious entry onion router will detect the embedded signal based on the received cells and confirm the communication relationship among users. We have implemented this attack against Tor and our experimental data validate its feasibility and effectiveness. There are several unique features of this attack. First, this attack is highly efficient and can confirm very short communication sessions with only tens of cells. Second, this attack is effective and its detection rate approaches 100% with a very low false positive rate. Third, it is possible to implement the attack in a way that appears to be very difficult for honest participants to detect (e.g. using our hopping-based signal embedding)."
ACM CCS 2009,False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids.,"A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power generators to consumers through power transmission and distribution networks across a large geographical area. System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, and state estimation is used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, including the interacting bad measurements introduced by arbitrary, non-random causes. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements injected by attackers."
ACM CCS 2009,"RFID privacy - relation between two notions, minimal condition, and efficient construction.","Privacy of RFID systems is receiving increasing attention in the RFID community. Basically, there are two kinds of RFID privacy notions: one based on the indistinguishability of two tags, denoted as ind-privacy, and the other based on the unpredictability of the output of a protocol, denoted as unp-privacy. In this paper, the definition of unp-privacy is refined and the relation between the two notions is clarified: it is proven that ind-privacy is weaker than unp-privacy. Moreover, the minimal (necessary and sufficient)condition on RFID tags to achieve unp-privacy is determined. It is shown that if an RFID system has strong (or weak) unp-privacy then the computational power of an RFID tag can be used to construct a pseudorandom function family provided that the RFID system is complete and sound. On the other hand, if each tag is able to compute a pseudorandom function, then the tags can be used to construct an RFID system with strong (or weak) unp-privacy. In this sense, a pseudorandom function family is the minimal requirement on an RFID tag's computational power for enforcing strong RFID system privacy. Finally, a new RFID protocol is proposed to satisfy the minimal requirement, which also outperforms the state-of-the-art RFID protocols in terms of computational cost and communication overhead."
ACM CCS 2009,SMILE - encounter-based trust for mobile social services.,"Conventional mobile social services such as Loopt and Google Latitude rely on two classes of trusted relationships: participants trust a centralized server to manage their location information and trust between users is based on existing social relationships. Unfortunately, these assumptions are not secure or general enough for many mobile social scenarios: centralized servers cannot always be relied upon to preserve data confidentiality, and users may want to use mobile social services to establish new relationships. To address these shortcomings, this paper describes SMILE, a privacy-preserving ""missed-connections"" service in which the service provider is untrusted and users are not assumed to have pre-established social relationships with each other. At a high-level, SMILE uses short-range wireless communication and standard cryptographic primitives to mimic the behavior of users in existing missed-connections services such as Craigslist: trust is founded solely on anonymous users' ability to prove to each other that they shared an encounter in the past. We have evaluated SMILE using protocol analysis, an informal study of Craigslist usage, and experiments with a prototype implementation and found it to be both privacy-preserving and feasible."
ACM CCS 2009,English shellcode.,"History indicates that the security community commonly takes a divide-and-conquer approach to battling malware threats: identify the essential and inalienable components of an attack, then develop detection and prevention techniques that directly target one or more of the essential components. This abstraction is evident in much of the literature for buffer overflow attacks including, for instance, stack protection and NOP sled detection. It comes as no surprise then that we approach shellcode detection and prevention in a similar fashion. However, the common belief that components of polymorphic shellcode (e.g., the decoder) cannot reliably be hidden suggests a more implicit and broader assumption that continues to drive contemporary research: namely, that valid and complete representations of shellcode are fundamentally different in structure than benign payloads. While the first tenet of this assumption is philosophically undeniable (i.e., a string of bytes is either shellcode or it is not), truth of the latter claim is less obvious if there exist encoding techniques capable of producing shellcode with features nearly indistinguishable from non-executable content. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that shellcode must conform to superficial and discernible representations. Specifically, we demonstrate a technique for automatically producing English Shellcode, transforming arbitrary shellcode into a representation that is superficially similar to English prose. The shellcode is completely self-contained---i.e., it does not require an external loader and executes as valid IA32 code)---and can typically be generated in under an hour on commodity hardware. Our primary objective in this paper is to promote discussion and stimulate new ideas for thinking ahead about preventive measures for tackling evolutions in code-injection attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,Scalable onion routing with torsk.,"We introduce Torsk, a structured peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. Torsk is designed as an interoperable replacement for the relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay to connections made via Tor. The resulting bandwidth savings make a modest-sized Torsk network significantly cheaper to operate, and allows low-bandwidth clients to join the network."
ACM CCS 2009,Secure open source collaboration - an empirical study of linus&apos; law.,"Open source software is often considered to be secure. One factor in this confidence in the security of open source software lies in leveraging large developer communities to find vulnerabilities in the code. Eric Raymond declares Linus' Law ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" Does Linus' Law hold up ad infinitum? Or, can the multitude of developers become ""too many cooks in the kitchen"", causing the system's security to suffer as a result? In this study, we examine the security of an open source project in the context of developer collaboration. By analyzing version control logs, we quantified notions of Linus' Law as well as the ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" viewpoint into developer activity metrics. We performed an empirical case study by examining correlations between the known security vulnerabilities in the open source Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel and developer activity metrics. Files developed by otherwise-independent developer groups were more likely to have a vulnerability, supporting Linus' Law. However, files with changes from nine or more developers were 16 times more likely to have a vulnerability than files changed by fewer than nine developers, indicating that many developers changing code may have a detrimental effect on the system's security."
ACM CCS 2009,ShadowWalker - peer-to-peer anonymous communication using redundant structured topologies.,"Peer-to-peer approaches to anonymous communication promise to eliminate the scalability concerns and central vulnerability points of current networks such as Tor. However, the P2P setting introduces many new opportunities for attack, and previous designs do not provide an adequate level of anonymity. We propose ShadowWalker: a new low-latency P2P anonymous communication system, based on a random walk over a redundant structured topology. We base our design on shadows that redundantly check and certify neighbor information; these certifications enable nodes to perform random walks over the structured topology while avoiding route capture and other attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,Effective implementation of the cell broadband engineTM isolation loader.,"This paper presents the design and implementation of the Cell Broadband Engine TM(Cell/B.E.) isolation loader which is a part of the IBM Software Development Kit for Multicore Acceleration [14]. Our isolation loader is a key component in realizing secure application boot and encrypted application execution. During the application load process, the isolation loader fetches, validates, and decrypts a Synergistic Processor Element (SPE) executable, establishing a chain of trust from the hardware to the application. Since not all applications are SPE executables, we also introduce a general solution. This is a verification service framework in which all applications including system functions can be verified by the isolation loader immediately before execution."
ACM CCS 2009,NISAN - network information service for anonymization networks.,"Network information distribution is a fundamental service for any anonymization network. Even though anonymization and information distribution about the network are two orthogonal issues, the design of the distribution service has a direct impact on the anonymization. Requiring each node to know about all other nodes in the network (as in Tor and AN.ON -- the most popular anonymization networks) limits scalability and offers a playground for intersection attacks. The distributed designs existing so far fail to meet security requirements and have therefore not been accepted in real networks."
ACM CCS 2009,Proximity-based access control for implantable medical devices.,"We propose a proximity-based access control scheme for implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our scheme is based on ultrasonic distance-bounding and enables an implanted medical device to grant access to its resources only to those devices that are in its close proximity. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through tests in an emulated patient environment. We show that, although implanted, IMDs can successfully verify the proximity of other devices with high accuracy. We propose a set of protocols that support our scheme, analyze their security in detail and discuss possible extensions. We make new observations about the security of implementations of ultrasonic distance-bounding protocols. Finally, we discuss the integration of our scheme with existing IMD devices and with their existing security measures."
ACM CCS 2009,The fable of the bees - incentivizing robust revocation decision making in ad hoc networks.,In this paper we present a new key-revocation scheme for ad hoc network environments with the following characteristics:
ACM CCS 2009,"Hey, you, get off of my cloud - exploring information leakage in third-party compute clouds.","Third-party cloud computing represents the promise of outsourcing as applied to computation. Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's EC2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on the same machine."
ACM CCS 2009,Secure in-VM monitoring using hardware virtualization.,"Kernel-level attacks or rootkits can compromise the security of an operating system by executing with the privilege of the kernel. Current approaches use virtualization to gain higher privilege over these attacks, and isolate security tools from the untrusted guest VM by moving them out and placing them in a separate trusted VM. Although out-of-VM isolation can help ensure security, the added overhead of world-switches between the guest VMs for each invocation of the monitor makes this approach unsuitable for many applications, especially fine-grained monitoring. In this paper, we present Secure In-VM Monitoring (SIM), a general-purpose framework that enables security monitoring applications to be placed back in the untrusted guest VM for efficiency without sacrificing the security guarantees provided by running them outside of the VM. We utilize contemporary hardware memory protection and hardware virtualization features available in recent processors to create a hypervisor protected address space where a monitor can execute and access data in native speeds and to which execution is transferred in a controlled manner that does not require hypervisor involvement. We have developed a prototype into KVM utilizing Intel VT hardware virtualization technology. We have also developed two representative applications for the Windows OS that monitor system calls and process creations. Our microbenchmarks show at least 10 times performance improvement in invocation of a monitor inside SIM over a monitor residing in another trusted VM. With a systematic security analysis of SIM against a number of possible threats, we show that SIM provides at least the same security guarantees as what can be achieved by out-of-VM monitors."
ACM CCS 2009,Can they hear me now? - a security analysis of law enforcement wiretaps.,"Although modern communications services are susceptible to third-party eavesdropping via a wide range of possible techniques, law enforcement agencies in the US and other countries generally use one of two technologies when they conduct legally-authorized interception of telephones and other communications traffic. The most common of these, designed to comply with the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act(CALEA), use a standard interface provided in network switches."
ACM CCS 2009,A metadata calculus for secure information sharing.,"In both commercial and defense sectors a compelling need is emerging for rapid, yet secure, dissemination of information to the concerned actors. Traditional approaches to information sharing that rely on security labels (e.g., Multi-Level Security (MLS)) suffer from at least two major drawbacks. First, static security labels do not account for tactical information whose value decays over time. Second, MLS-like approaches have often ignored information transform semantics when deducing security labels (e.g., output security label = max over all input security labels). While MLS-like label deduction appears to be conservative, we argue that this approach can result in both underestimation and overestimation of security labels. We contend that overestimation may adversely throttle information flows, while underestimation incites information misuse and leakage."
ACM CCS 2009,Your botnet is my botnet - analysis of a botnet takeover.,"Botnets, networks of malware-infected machines that are controlled by an adversary, are the root cause of a large number of security problems on the Internet. A particularly sophisticated and insidious type of bot is Torpig, a malware program that is designed to harvest sensitive information (such as bank account and credit card data) from its victims. In this paper, we report on our efforts to take control of the Torpig botnet and study its operations for a period of ten days. During this time, we observed more than 180 thousand infections and recorded almost 70 GB of data that the bots collected. While botnets have been ""hijacked"" and studied previously, the Torpig botnet exhibits certain properties that make the analysis of the data particularly interesting. First, it is possible (with reasonable accuracy) to identify unique bot infections and relate that number to the more than 1.2 million IP addresses that contacted our command and control server. Second, the Torpig botnet is large, targets a variety of applications, and gathers a rich and diverse set of data from the infected victims. This data provides a new understanding of the type and amount of personal information that is stolen by botnets."
ACM CCS 2009,On voting machine design for verification and testability.,"We present an approach for the design and analysis of an electronic voting machine based on a novel combination of formal verification and systematic testing. The system was designed specifically to enable verification and testing. In our architecture, the voting machine is a finite-state transducer that implements the bare essentials required for an election. We formally specify how each component of the machine is intended to work and formally verify that a Verilog implementation of our design meets this specification. However, it is more challenging to verify that the composition of these components will behave as a voter would expect, because formalizing human expectations is difficult. We show how systematic testing can be used to address this issue, and in particular to verify that the machine will behave correctly on election day."
ACM CCS 2009,On cellular botnets - measuring the impact of malicious devices on a cellular network core.,"The vast expansion of interconnectivity with the Internet and the rapid evolution of highly-capable but largely insecure mobile devices threatens cellular networks. In this paper, we characterize the impact of the large scale compromise and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a combination of measurement, simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the ability of a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compromised mobile phones to degrade service to area-code sized regions by 93%. As such attacks are accomplished through the execution of network service requests and not a constant stream of phone calls, users are unlikely to be aware of their occurrence. We then investigate a number of significant network bottlenecks, their impact on the density of compromised nodes per base station and how they can be avoided. We conclude by discussing a number of countermeasures that may help to partially mitigate the threats posed by such attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,The bayesian traffic analysis of mix networks.,"This work casts the traffic analysis of anonymity systems, and in particular mix networks, in the context of Bayesian inference. A generative probabilistic model of mix network architectures is presented, that incorporates a number of attack techniques in the traffic analysis literature. We use the model to build an Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference engine, that calculates the probabilities of who is talking to whom given an observation of network traces. We provide a thorough evaluation of its correctness and performance, and confirm that mix networks with realistic parameters are secure. This approach enables us to apply established information theoretic anonymity metrics on complex mix networks, and extract information from anonymised traffic traces optimally."
ACM CCS 2009,Membership-concealing overlay networks.,"We introduce the concept of membership-concealing overlay networks (MCONs), which hide the real-world identities of participants. We argue that while membership concealment is orthogonal to anonymity and censorship resistance, pseudonymous communication and censorship resistance become much easier if done over a membership-concealing network. We formalize the concept of membership concealment, discuss a number of attacks against existing systems and present real-world attack results. We then propose three proof-of-concept MCON designs that resist those attacks: one that is more efficient, another that is more robust to membership churn, and a third that balances efficiency and robustness. We show theoretical and simulation results demonstrating the feasibility and performance of our schemes."
ACM CCS 2009,Ripley - automatically securing web 2.0 applications through replicated execution.,"Rich Internet applications are becoming increasingly distributed, as demonstrated by the popularity of AJAX or Web 2.0 applications such as Facebook, Google Maps, Hotmail and many others. A typical multi-tier AJAX application consists, at least, of a server-side component implemented in Java J2EE, PHP or ASP.NET and a client-side component running JavaScript. The resulting application is more responsive because computation has moved closer to the client, avoiding unnecessary network round trips for frequent user actions."
ACM CCS 2009,Countering kernel rootkits with lightweight hook protection.,"Kernel rootkits have posed serious security threats due to their stealthy manner. To hide their presence and activities, many rootkits hijack control flows by modifying control data or hooks in the kernel space. A critical step towards eliminating rootkits is to protect such hooks from being hijacked. However, it remains a challenge because there exist a large number of widely-scattered kernel hooks and many of them could be dynamically allocated from kernel heap and co-located together with other kernel data. In addition, there is a lack of flexible commodity hardware support, leading to the socalled protection granularity gap -- kernel hook protection requires byte-level granularity but commodity hardware only provides page level protection."
ACM CCS 2009,Behavior based software theft detection.,"Along with the burst of open source projects, software theft (or plagiarism) has become a very serious threat to the healthiness of software industry. Software birthmark, which represents the unique characteristics of a program, can be used for software theft detection. We propose a system call dependence graph based software birthmark called SCDG birthmark, and examine how well it reflects unique behavioral characteristics of a program. To our knowledge, our detection system based on SCDG birthmark is the first one that is capable of detecting software component theft where only partial code is stolen. We demonstrate the strength of our birthmark against various evasion techniques, including those based on different compilers and different compiler optimization levels as well as two state-of-the-art obfuscation tools. Unlike the existing work that were evaluated through small or toy software, we also evaluate our birthmark on a set of large software. Our results show that SCDG birthmark is very practical and effective in detecting software theft that even adopts advanced evasion techniques."
ACM CCS 2009,Learning your identity and disease from research papers - information leaks in genome wide association study.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim at discovering the association between genetic variations, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and common diseases, which is well recognized to be one of the most important and active areas in biomedical research. Also renowned is the privacy implication of such studies, which has been brought into the limelight by the recent attack proposed by Homer et al. Homer's attack demonstrates that it is possible to identify a GWAS participant from the allele frequencies of a large number of SNPs. Such a threat, unfortunately, was found in our research to be significantly understated. In this paper, we show that individuals can actually be identified from even a relatively small set of statistics, as those routinely published in GWAS papers. We present two attacks. The first one extends Homer's attack with a much more powerful test statistic, based on the correlations among different SNPs described by coefficient of determination (r2). This attack can determine the presence of an individual from the statistics related to a couple of hundred SNPs. The second attack can lead to complete disclosure of hundreds of participants' SNPs, through analyzing the information derived from published statistics. We also found that those attacks can succeed even when the precisions of the statistics are low and part of data is missing. We evaluated our attacks on the real human genomes and concluded that such threats are completely realistic."
ACM CCS 2009,Privacy-preserving genomic computation through program specialization.,"In this paper, we present a new approach to performing important classes of genomic computations (e.g., search for homologous genes) that makes a significant step towards privacy protection in this domain. Our approach leverages a key property of the human genome, namely that the vast majority of it is shared across humans (and hence public), and consequently relatively little of it is sensitive. Based on this observation, we propose a privacy-protection framework that partitions a genomic computation, distributing the part on sensitive data to the data provider and the part on the pubic data to the user of the data. Such a partition is achieved through program specialization that enables a biocomputing program to perform a concrete execution on public data and a symbolic execution on sensitive data. As a result, the program is simplified into an efficient query program that takes only sensitive genetic data as inputs. We prove the effectiveness of our techniques on a set of dynamic programming algorithms common in genomic computing. We develop a program transformation tool that automatically instruments a legacy program for specialization operations. We also demonstrate that our techniques can greatly facilitate secure multi-party computations on large biocomputing problems."
ACM CCS 2009,Feeling-based location privacy protection for location-based services.,"Anonymous location information may be correlated with restricted spaces such as home and office for subject re-identification. This makes it a great challenge to provide location privacy protection for users of location-based services. Existing work adopts traditional K-anonymity model and ensures that each location disclosed in service requests is a spatial region that has been visited by at least K users. This strategy requires a user to specify an appropriate value of K in order to achieve a desired level of privacy protection. This is problematic because privacy is about feeling, and it is awkward for one to scale her feeling using a number. In this paper, we propose a feeling-based privacy model. The model allows a user to express her privacy requirement by specifying a public region, which the user would feel comfortable if the region is reported as her location. The popularity of the public region, measured using entropy based on its visitors' footprints inside it, is then used as the user's desired level of privacy protection. With this model in place, we present a novel technique that allows a user's location information to be reported as accurate as possible while providing her sufficient location privacy protection. The new technique supports trajectory cloaking and can be used in application scenarios where a user needs to make frequent location updates along a trajectory that cannot be predicted. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed technique under various conditions through simulation, we have also implemented an experimental system for location privacy-aware uses of location-based services."
ACM CCS 2009,Filter-resistant code injection on ARM.,"Code injections attacks are one of the most powerful and important classes of attacks on software. In such attacks, the attacker sends malicious input to a software application, where it is stored in memory. The malicious input is chosen in such a way that its representation in memory is also a valid representation of a machine code program that performs actions chosen by the attacker. The attacker then triggers a bug in the application to divert the control flow to this injected machine code. A typical action of the injected code is to launch a command interpreter shell, and hence the malicious input is often called shellcode."

ACM CCS 2009,Attacking cryptographic schemes based on &quot;perturbation polynomials&quot;.,"We show attacks on several cryptographic schemes that have recently been proposed for achieving various security goals in sensor networks. Roughly speaking, these schemes all use ""perturbation polynomials"" to add ""noise"" to polynomialbased systems that offer information-theoretic security, in an attempt to increase the resilience threshold while maintaining efficiency. We show that the heuristic security arguments given for these modified schemes do not hold, and that they can be completely broken once we allow even a slight extension of the parameters beyond those achieved by the underlying information-theoretic schemes."
ACM CCS 2009,On achieving good operating points on an ROC plane using stochastic anomaly score prediction.,"ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we argue that a real-time IDS' input changes considerably over time and ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve. To address this problem, we propose a simple, generic and adaptive technique to achieve good ROC operating points for any given IDS. The proposed technique stochastically predicts the next anomaly score of an IDS and the anomaly classification threshold is then set as a function of the predicted score. We first perform statistical and information-theoretic analyses of network- and host-based IDSs' anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains and then use this model to predict and adapt an IDS' classification threshold. The proposed adaptive thresholding module is incorporated into six prominent network- and host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs). These adaptive ADSs are evaluated on public and labeled attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need for manual threshold configuration and having very low-complexity, adaptive thresholding enables the ADSs to achieve considerably higher accuracies on the ROC plane."
ACM CCS 2009,CoSP - a general framework for computational soundness proofs.,"We describe CoSP, a general framework for conducting computational soundness proofs of symbolic models and for embedding these proofs into formal calculi. CoSP considers arbitrary equational theories and computational implementations, and it abstracts away many details that are not crucial for proving computational soundness, such as message scheduling, corruption models, and even the internal structure of a protocol. CoSP enables soundness results, in the sense of preservation of trace properties, to be proven in a conceptually modular and generic way: proving x cryptographic primitives sound for y calculi only requires x + y proofs (instead of x • y proofs without this framework), and the process of embedding calculi is conceptually decoupled from computational soundness proofs of cryptographic primitives. We exemplify the usefulness of CoSP by proving the first computational soundness result for the full-fledged applied π-calculus under active attacks. Concretely, we embed the applied π-calculus into CoSP and give a sound implementation of public-key encryption and digital signatures."
ACM CCS 2009,An efficient forward private RFID protocol.,"Radio Frequency IDentifiers (RFID) are low-cost pervasive devices used in various settings for identification purposes: although they have originally been introduced to ease the supply chain management, they are already used in many other applications. Some of these applications need secure identification and ad-hoc authentication protocols have to be designed for that purpose. But the intrusion of RFID in the life of end-users might additionally require a higher level of user-privacy. Such security and privacy requirements conflict with the highly constrained environment of RFID systems. Ohkubo, Suzuki, and Kinoshita first proposed an appealing RFID protocol that meets the highest privacy requirements. However, their scheme and its known variants suffer from limitations in terms of computational complexity and provable security which this paper aims to address. We propose a novel forward private authentication scheme built upon less computationally expensive cryptographic ingredients, namely pseudo-random generators and universal hash functions instead of one way hash functions. In contrast with existing schemes, we provide security proofs of our construction in the standard model instead of the random oracle model."
ACM CCS 2009,Anonymous credentials on a standard java card.,"Secure identity tokens such as Electronic Identity (eID) cards are emerging everywhere. At the same time user-centric identity management gains acceptance. Anonymous credential schemes are the optimal realization of user-centricity. However, on inexpensive hardware platforms, typically used for eID cards, these schemes could not be made to meet the necessary requirements such as future-proof key lengths and transaction times on the order of 10 seconds. The reasons for this is the need for the hardware platform to be standardized and certified. Therefore an implementation is only possible as a Java Card applet. This results in severe restrictions: little memory (transient and persistent), an 8-bit CPU, and access to hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations only by defined interfaces such as RSA encryption operations."
ACM CCS 2009,Reactive noninterference.,"Many programs operate reactively--patiently waiting for user input, running for a while producing output, and eventually returning to a state where they are ready to accept another input (or occasionally diverging). When a reactive program communicates with multiple parties, we would like to be sure that it can be given secret information by one without leaking it to others."
ACM CCS 2009,XCS - cross channel scripting and its impact on web applications.,"We study the security of embedded web servers used in consumer electronic devices, such as security cameras and photo frames, and for IT infrastructure, such as wireless access points and lights-out management systems. All the devices we examine turn out to be vulnerable to a variety of web attacks, including cross site scripting (XSS) and cross site request forgery (CSRF). In addition, we show that consumer electronics are particularly vulnerable to a nasty form of persistent XSS where a non-web channel such as NFS or SNMP is used to inject a malicious script. This script is later used to attack an unsuspecting user who connects to the device's web server. We refer to web attacks which are mounted through a non-web channel as cross channel scripting (XCS). We propose a client-side defense against certain XCS which we implement as a browser extension."
ACM CCS 2009,HAIL - a high-availability and integrity layer for cloud storage.,"We introduce HAIL (High-Availability and Integrity Layer), a distributed cryptographic system that allows a set of servers to prove to a client that a stored file is intact and retrievable. HAIL strengthens, formally unifies, and streamlines distinct approaches from the cryptographic and distributed-systems communities. Proofs in HAIL are efficiently computable by servers and highly compact---typically tens or hundreds of bytes, irrespective of file size. HAIL cryptographically verifies and reactively reallocates file shares. It is robust against an active, mobile adversary, i.e., one that may progressively corrupt the full set of servers. We propose a strong, formal adversarial model for HAIL, and rigorous analysis and parameter choices. We show how HAIL improves on the security and efficiency of existing tools, like Proofs of Retrievability (PORs) deployed on individual servers. We also report on a prototype implementation."
ACM CCS 2009,Dispatcher - enabling active botnet infiltration using automatic protocol reverse-engineering.,"Automatic protocol reverse-engineering is important for many security applications, including the analysis and defense against botnets. Understanding the command-and-control (C&C) protocol used by a botnet is crucial for anticipating its repertoire of nefarious activity and to enable active botnet infiltration. Frequently, security analysts need to rewrite messages sent and received by a bot in order to contain malicious activity and to provide the botmaster with an illusion of successful and unhampered operation. To enable such rewriting, we need detailed information about the intent and structure of the messages in both directions of the communication despite the fact that we generally only have access to the implementation of one endpoint, namely the bot binary. Current techniques cannot enable such rewriting. In this paper, we propose techniques to extract the format of protocol messages sent by an application that implements a protocol specification, and to infer the field semantics for messages both sent and received by the application. Our techniques enable applications such as rewriting the C&C messages for active botnet infiltration. We implement our techniques into Dispatcher, a tool to extract the message format and field semantics of both received and sent messages. We use Dispatcher to analyze MegaD, a prevalent spam botnet employing a hitherto undocumented C&C protocol, and show that the protocol information extracted by Dispatcher can be used to rewrite the C&C messages."
ACM CCS 2009,Oblivious transfer with access control.,"We present a protocol for anonymous access to a database where the different records have different access control permissions. These permissions could be attributes, roles, or rights that the user needs to have in order to access the record. Our protocol offers maximal security guarantees for both the database and the user, namely (1) only authorized users can access the record; (2) the database provider does not learn which record the user accesses; and (3) the database provider does not learn which attributes or roles the user has when she accesses the database."
ACM CCS 2009,Mapping kernel objects to enable systematic integrity checking.,"Dynamic kernel data have become an attractive target for kernel-mode malware. However, previous solutions for checking kernel integrity either limit themselves to code and static data or can only inspect a fraction of dynamic data, resulting in limited protection. Our study shows that previous solutions may reach only 28% of the dynamic kernel data and thus may fail to identify function pointers manipulated by many kernel-mode malware."
ACM CCS 2009,On the difficulty of software-based attestation of embedded devices.,"Device attestation is an essential feature in many security protocols and applications. The lack of dedicated hardware and the impossibility to physically access devices to be attested, makes attestation of embedded devices, in applications such as Wireless Sensor Networks, a prominent challenge. Several software-based attestation techniques have been proposed that either rely on tight time constraints or on the lack of free space to store malicious code. This paper investigates the shortcomings of existing software-based attestation techniques. We first present two generic attacks, one based on a return-oriented rootkit} and the other on code compression. We further describe specific attacks on two existing proposals, namely SWATT and ICE-based schemes, and argue about the difficulty of fixing them. All attacks presented in this paper were implemented and validated on commodity sensors."
ACM CCS 2009,Certificateless onion routing.,"Onion routing protocols allow users to establish anonymous channels to preserve their privacy over a public network. Several protocols implementing this primitive have been proposed in recent years, and TOR, a real-life implementation, provides an onion routing service to thousands of users over the internet."
ACM CCS 2009,Improving privacy and security in multi-authority attribute-based encryption.,"Attribute based encryption (ABE) [13] determines decryption ability based on a user's attributes. In a multi-authority ABE scheme, multiple attribute-authorities monitor different sets of attributes and issue corresponding decryption keys to users, and encryptors can require that a user obtain keys for appropriate attributes from each authority before decrypting a message. Chase [5] gave a multi-authority ABE scheme using the concepts of a trusted central authority (CA) and global identifiers (GID). However, the CA in that construction has the power to decrypt every ciphertext, which seems somehow contradictory to the original goal of distributing control over many potentially untrusted authorities. Moreover, in that construction, the use of a consistent GID allowed the authorities to combine their information to build a full profile with all of a user's attributes, which unnecessarily compromises the privacy of the user. In this paper, we propose a solution which removes the trusted central authority, and protects the users' privacy by preventing the authorities from pooling their information on particular users, thus making ABE more usable in practice."
ACM CCS 2009,Multiple password interference in text passwords and click-based graphical passwords.,"The underlying issues relating to the usability and security of multiple passwords are largely unexplored. However, we know that people generally have difficulty remembering multiple passwords. This reduces security since users reuse the same password for different systems or reveal other passwords as they try to log in. We report on a laboratory study comparing recall of multiple text passwords with recall of multiple click-based graphical passwords. In a one-hour session (short-term), we found that participants in the graphical password condition coped significantly better than those in the text password condition. In particular, they made fewer errors when recalling their passwords, did not resort to creating passwords directly related to account names, and did not use similar passwords across multiple accounts. After two weeks, participants in the two conditions had recall success rates that were not statistically different from each other, but those with text passwords made more recall errors than participants with graphical passwords. In our study, click-based graphical passwords were significantly less susceptible to multiple password interference in the short-term, while having comparable usability to text passwords in most other respects."
ACM CCS 2009,Robust signatures for kernel data structures.,"Kernel-mode rootkits hide objects such as processes and threads using a technique known as Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM). Many forensic analysis tools attempt to detect these hidden objects by scanning kernel memory with handmade signatures; however, such signatures are brittle and rely on non-essential features of these data structures, making them easy to evade. In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for generating signatures for kernel data structures and show that these signatures are robust: attempts to evade the signature by modifying the structure contents will cause the OS to consider the object invalid. Using dynamic analysis, we profile the target data structure to determine commonly used fields, and we then fuzz those fields to determine which are essential to the correct operation of the OS. These fields form the basis of a signature for the data structure. In our experiments, our new signature matched the accuracy of existing scanners for traditional malware and found processes hidden with our prototype rootkit that all current signatures missed. Our techniques significantly increase the difficulty of hiding objects from signature scanning."
ACM CCS 2009,As-awareness in Tor path selection.,"Tor is an anonymous communications network with thousands of router nodes worldwide. An intuition reflected in much of the literature on anonymous communications is that, as an anonymity network grows, it becomes more secure against a given observer because the observer will see less of the network. In particular, as the Tor network grows from volunteers operating relays all over the world, it becomes less and less likely for a single autonomous system (AS) to be able to observe both ends of an anonymous connection. Yet, as the network continues to grow significantly, no analysis has been done to determine if this intuition is correct. Further, modifications to Tor's path selection algorithm to help clients avoid an AS-level observer have not been proposed and analyzed."
ACM CCS 2009,On lightweight mobile phone application certification.,"Users have begun downloading an increasingly large number of mobile phone applications in response to advancements in handsets and wireless networks. The increased number of applications results in a greater chance of installing Trojans and similar malware. In this paper, we propose the Kirin security service for Android, which performs lightweight certification of applications to mitigate malware at install time. Kirin certification uses security rules, which are templates designed to conservatively match undesirable properties in security configuration bundled with applications. We use a variant of security requirements engineering techniques to perform an in-depth security analysis of Android to produce a set of rules that match malware characteristics. In a sample of 311 of the most popular applications downloaded from the official Android Market, Kirin and our rules found 5 applications that implement dangerous functionality and therefore should be installed with extreme caution. Upon close inspection, another five applications asserted dangerous rights, but were within the scope of reasonable functional needs. These results indicate that security configuration bundled with Android applications provides practical means of detecting malware."
ACM CCS 2009,Dynamic provable data possession.,"We consider the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files."
ACM CCS 2009,A security-preserving compiler for distributed programs - from information-flow policies to cryptographic mechanisms.,"We enforce information flow policies in programs that run at multiple locations, with diverse levels of security."
ACM CCS 2009,A probabilistic approach to hybrid role mining.,"Role mining algorithms address an important access control problem: configuring a role-based access control system. Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role mining discovers a set of roles together with an assignment of users to roles. The results should closely agree with the direct assignment. Moreover, the roles should be understandable from the business perspective in that they reflect functional roles within the enterprise. This requires hybrid role mining methods that work with both direct assignments and business information from the enterprise."
ACM CCS 2009,On non-cooperative location privacy - a game-theoretic analysis.,"In mobile networks, authentication is a required primitive for the majority of security protocols. However, an adversary can track the location of mobile nodes by monitoring pseudonyms used for authentication. A frequently proposed solution to protect location privacy suggests that mobile nodes collectively change their pseudonyms in regions called mix zones. Because this approach is costly, self-interested mobile nodes might decide not to cooperate and could thus jeopardize the achievable location privacy. In this paper, we analyze the non-cooperative behavior of mobile nodes by using a game-theoretic model, where each player aims at maximizing its location privacy at a minimum cost. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in n-player complete information games. Because mobile nodes in a privacy-sensitive system do not know their opponents' payoffs, we then consider incomplete information games. We establish that symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibria exist with simple threshold strategies in n-player games and derive the equilibrium strategies. By means of numerical results, we show that mobile nodes become selfish when the cost of changing pseudonyms is small, whereas they cooperate more when the cost of changing pseudonyms increases. Finally, we design a protocol - the PseudoGame protocol - based on the results of our analysis."
ACM CCS 2009,Battle of Botcraft - fighting bots in online games with human observational proofs.,"The abuse of online games by automated programs, known as game bots, for gaining unfair advantages has plagued millions of participating players with escalating severity in recent years. The current methods for distinguishing bots and humans are based on human interactive proofs (HIPs), such as CAPTCHAs. However, HIP-based approaches have inherent drawbacks. In particular, they are too obtrusive to be tolerated by human players in a gaming context. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive approach based on human observational proofs (HOPs) for continuous game bot detection. HOPs differentiate bots from human players by passively monitoring input actions that are difficult for current bots to perform in a human-like manner. We collect a series of user-input traces in one of the most popular online games, World of Warcraft. Based on the traces, we characterize the game playing behaviors of bots and humans. Then, we develop a HOP-based game bot defense system that analyzes user-input actions with a cascade-correlation neural network to distinguish bots from humans. The HOP system is effective in capturing current game bots, which raises the bar against game exploits and forces a determined adversary to build more complicated game bots for detection evasion in the future."
ACM CCS 2009,Multi-party off-the-record messaging.,"Most cryptographic algorithms provide a means for secret and authentic communication. However, under many circumstances, the ability to repudiate messages or deny a conversation is no less important than secrecy and authenticity. For whistleblowers, informants, political dissidents and journalists --- to name a few --- it is most important to have means for deniable conversation, where electronic communication must mimic face-to-face private meetings. Off-the-Record Messaging, proposed in 2004 by Borisov, Goldberg and Brewer, and its subsequent improvements, simulate private two-party meetings. Despite some attempts, the multi-party scenario remains unresolved."
ACM CCS 2009,Large-scale malware indexing using function-call graphs.,"A major challenge of the anti-virus (AV) industry is how to effectively process the huge influx of malware samples they receive every day. One possible solution to this problem is to quickly determine if a new malware sample is similar to any previously-seen malware program. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate a malware database management system called SMIT (Symantec Malware Indexing Tree) that can efficiently make such determination based on malware's function-call graphs, which is a structural representation known to be less susceptible to instruction-level obfuscations commonly employed by malware writers to evade detection of AV software. Because each malware program is represented as a graph, the problem of searching for the most similar malware program in a database to a given malware sample is cast into a nearest-neighbor search problem in a graph database. To speed up this search, we have developed an efficient method to compute graph similarity that exploits structural and instruction-level information in the underlying malware programs, and a multi-resolution indexing scheme that uses a computationally economical feature vector for early pruning and resorts to a more accurate but computationally more expensive graph similarity function only when it needs to pinpoint the most similar neighbors. Results of a comprehensive performance study of the SMIT prototype using a database of more than 100,000 malware demonstrate the effective pruning power and scalability of its nearest neighbor search mechanisms."
ACM CCS 2009,Fides - remote anomaly-based cheat detection using client emulation.,"As a result of physically owning the client machine, cheaters in online games currently have the upper-hand when it comes to avoiding detection. To address this problem and turn the table on cheaters, this paper presents Fides, an anomaly-based cheat detection approach that remotely validates game execution. With Fides, a server-side Controller specifies how and when a client-side Auditor measures the game. To accurately validate measurements, the Controller partially emulates the client and collaborates with the server. This paper examines a range of cheat methods and initial measurements that counter them, showing that a Fides prototype is able to efficiently detect several existing cheats, including one state-of-the-art cheat that is advertised as ""undetectable""."
ACM CCS 2009,"EPC RFID tag security weaknesses and defenses - passport cards, enhanced drivers licenses, and beyond.","EPC (Electronic Product Code) tags are industry-standard RFID devices poised to supplant optical barcodes in many applications. We explore the systemic risks and challenges created by the increasingly common use of EPC for security applications. As a central case study, we examine the recently issued United States Passport Card and Washington State ""enhanced drivers license"" (WA EDL), both of which incorporate Gen-2 EPC tags. We measure multiple weaknesses, including susceptibility to cloning, extended read ranges, and the ability to remotely kill a WA EDL. We study the implications of these vulnerabilities to overall system security, and offer suggestions for improvement. We demonstrate anti-cloning techniques for off-the-shelf EPC tags, overcoming practical challenges in a previous proposal to co-opt the EPC ""kill"" command to achieve tag authentication. Our paper fills a vacuum of experimentally grounded evaluation of and guidance for security applications for EPC tags not just in identity documents, but more broadly in the authentication of objects and people."
ACM CCS 2009,Computational soundness for key exchange protocols with symmetric encryption.,"Formal analysis of security protocols based on symbolic models has been very successful in finding flaws in published protocols and proving protocols secure, using automated tools. An important question is whether this kind of formal analysis implies security guarantees in the strong sense of modern cryptography. Initiated by the seminal work of Abadi and Rogaway, this question has been investigated and numerous positive results showing this so-called computational soundness of formal analysis have been obtained. However, for the case of active adversaries and protocols that use symmetric encryption computational soundness has remained a challenge."
ACM CCS 2009,Efficient pseudorandom functions from the decisional linear assumption and weaker variants.,"In this paper, we generalize Naor and Reingold's construction of pseudorandom functions under the DDH Assumption [22] to yield a construction of pseudorandom functions under the decisional k-Linear Assumption, for each k › 1. The decisional Linear Assumption was first introduced by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham in [5] as an alternative assumption for settings where the DDH problem is easy, such as bilinear groups. Shacham [25] and Hofheinz and Kiltz [16] independently introduced the generalized decisional k-Linear Assumptions and showed that the decisional (k+1)-Linear problem is hard for generic groups even when the decisional k-Linear problem is easy. It is thus desirable to have constructions of cryptographic primitives based on the decisional k-Linear Assumption instead of DDH. Not surprisingly, one must pay a small price for added security: as k increases, our constructed functions become slightly less efficient to compute and the key size increases (quadratically in k)."
ACM CCS 2009,Finding bugs in exceptional situations of JNI programs.,"Software flaws in native methods may defeat Java's guarantees of safety and security. One common kind of flaws in native methods results from the discrepancy on how exceptions are handled in Java and in native methods. Unlike exceptions in Java, exceptions raised in the native code through the Java Native Interface (JNI) are not controlled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Only after the native code finishes execution will the JVM's mechanism for exceptions take over. This discrepancy makes handling of JNI exceptions an error prone process and can cause serious security flaws in software written using the JNI."
ACM CCS 2009,A new cell counter based attack against tor.,"Various low-latency anonymous communication systems such as Tor and Anoymizer have been designed to provide anonymity service for users. In order to hide the communication of users, many anonymity systems pack the application data into equal-sized cells (e.g., 512 bytes for Tor, a known real-world, circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication network). In this paper, we investigate a new cell counter based attack against Tor, which allows the attacker to confirm anonymous communication relationship among users very quickly. In this attack, by marginally varying the counter of cells in the target traffic at the malicious exit onion router, the attacker can embed a secret signal into the variation of cell counter of the target traffic. The embedded signal will be carried along with the target traffic and arrive at the malicious entry onion router. Then an accomplice of the attacker at the malicious entry onion router will detect the embedded signal based on the received cells and confirm the communication relationship among users. We have implemented this attack against Tor and our experimental data validate its feasibility and effectiveness. There are several unique features of this attack. First, this attack is highly efficient and can confirm very short communication sessions with only tens of cells. Second, this attack is effective and its detection rate approaches 100% with a very low false positive rate. Third, it is possible to implement the attack in a way that appears to be very difficult for honest participants to detect (e.g. using our hopping-based signal embedding)."
ACM CCS 2009,False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids.,"A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power generators to consumers through power transmission and distribution networks across a large geographical area. System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, and state estimation is used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, including the interacting bad measurements introduced by arbitrary, non-random causes. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements injected by attackers."
ACM CCS 2009,"RFID privacy - relation between two notions, minimal condition, and efficient construction.","Privacy of RFID systems is receiving increasing attention in the RFID community. Basically, there are two kinds of RFID privacy notions: one based on the indistinguishability of two tags, denoted as ind-privacy, and the other based on the unpredictability of the output of a protocol, denoted as unp-privacy. In this paper, the definition of unp-privacy is refined and the relation between the two notions is clarified: it is proven that ind-privacy is weaker than unp-privacy. Moreover, the minimal (necessary and sufficient)condition on RFID tags to achieve unp-privacy is determined. It is shown that if an RFID system has strong (or weak) unp-privacy then the computational power of an RFID tag can be used to construct a pseudorandom function family provided that the RFID system is complete and sound. On the other hand, if each tag is able to compute a pseudorandom function, then the tags can be used to construct an RFID system with strong (or weak) unp-privacy. In this sense, a pseudorandom function family is the minimal requirement on an RFID tag's computational power for enforcing strong RFID system privacy. Finally, a new RFID protocol is proposed to satisfy the minimal requirement, which also outperforms the state-of-the-art RFID protocols in terms of computational cost and communication overhead."
ACM CCS 2009,SMILE - encounter-based trust for mobile social services.,"Conventional mobile social services such as Loopt and Google Latitude rely on two classes of trusted relationships: participants trust a centralized server to manage their location information and trust between users is based on existing social relationships. Unfortunately, these assumptions are not secure or general enough for many mobile social scenarios: centralized servers cannot always be relied upon to preserve data confidentiality, and users may want to use mobile social services to establish new relationships. To address these shortcomings, this paper describes SMILE, a privacy-preserving ""missed-connections"" service in which the service provider is untrusted and users are not assumed to have pre-established social relationships with each other. At a high-level, SMILE uses short-range wireless communication and standard cryptographic primitives to mimic the behavior of users in existing missed-connections services such as Craigslist: trust is founded solely on anonymous users' ability to prove to each other that they shared an encounter in the past. We have evaluated SMILE using protocol analysis, an informal study of Craigslist usage, and experiments with a prototype implementation and found it to be both privacy-preserving and feasible."
ACM CCS 2009,English shellcode.,"History indicates that the security community commonly takes a divide-and-conquer approach to battling malware threats: identify the essential and inalienable components of an attack, then develop detection and prevention techniques that directly target one or more of the essential components. This abstraction is evident in much of the literature for buffer overflow attacks including, for instance, stack protection and NOP sled detection. It comes as no surprise then that we approach shellcode detection and prevention in a similar fashion. However, the common belief that components of polymorphic shellcode (e.g., the decoder) cannot reliably be hidden suggests a more implicit and broader assumption that continues to drive contemporary research: namely, that valid and complete representations of shellcode are fundamentally different in structure than benign payloads. While the first tenet of this assumption is philosophically undeniable (i.e., a string of bytes is either shellcode or it is not), truth of the latter claim is less obvious if there exist encoding techniques capable of producing shellcode with features nearly indistinguishable from non-executable content. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that shellcode must conform to superficial and discernible representations. Specifically, we demonstrate a technique for automatically producing English Shellcode, transforming arbitrary shellcode into a representation that is superficially similar to English prose. The shellcode is completely self-contained---i.e., it does not require an external loader and executes as valid IA32 code)---and can typically be generated in under an hour on commodity hardware. Our primary objective in this paper is to promote discussion and stimulate new ideas for thinking ahead about preventive measures for tackling evolutions in code-injection attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,Scalable onion routing with torsk.,"We introduce Torsk, a structured peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. Torsk is designed as an interoperable replacement for the relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay to connections made via Tor. The resulting bandwidth savings make a modest-sized Torsk network significantly cheaper to operate, and allows low-bandwidth clients to join the network."
ACM CCS 2009,Secure open source collaboration - an empirical study of linus&apos; law.,"Open source software is often considered to be secure. One factor in this confidence in the security of open source software lies in leveraging large developer communities to find vulnerabilities in the code. Eric Raymond declares Linus' Law ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" Does Linus' Law hold up ad infinitum? Or, can the multitude of developers become ""too many cooks in the kitchen"", causing the system's security to suffer as a result? In this study, we examine the security of an open source project in the context of developer collaboration. By analyzing version control logs, we quantified notions of Linus' Law as well as the ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" viewpoint into developer activity metrics. We performed an empirical case study by examining correlations between the known security vulnerabilities in the open source Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel and developer activity metrics. Files developed by otherwise-independent developer groups were more likely to have a vulnerability, supporting Linus' Law. However, files with changes from nine or more developers were 16 times more likely to have a vulnerability than files changed by fewer than nine developers, indicating that many developers changing code may have a detrimental effect on the system's security."
ACM CCS 2009,ShadowWalker - peer-to-peer anonymous communication using redundant structured topologies.,"Peer-to-peer approaches to anonymous communication promise to eliminate the scalability concerns and central vulnerability points of current networks such as Tor. However, the P2P setting introduces many new opportunities for attack, and previous designs do not provide an adequate level of anonymity. We propose ShadowWalker: a new low-latency P2P anonymous communication system, based on a random walk over a redundant structured topology. We base our design on shadows that redundantly check and certify neighbor information; these certifications enable nodes to perform random walks over the structured topology while avoiding route capture and other attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,Effective implementation of the cell broadband engineTM isolation loader.,"This paper presents the design and implementation of the Cell Broadband Engine TM(Cell/B.E.) isolation loader which is a part of the IBM Software Development Kit for Multicore Acceleration [14]. Our isolation loader is a key component in realizing secure application boot and encrypted application execution. During the application load process, the isolation loader fetches, validates, and decrypts a Synergistic Processor Element (SPE) executable, establishing a chain of trust from the hardware to the application. Since not all applications are SPE executables, we also introduce a general solution. This is a verification service framework in which all applications including system functions can be verified by the isolation loader immediately before execution."
ACM CCS 2009,NISAN - network information service for anonymization networks.,"Network information distribution is a fundamental service for any anonymization network. Even though anonymization and information distribution about the network are two orthogonal issues, the design of the distribution service has a direct impact on the anonymization. Requiring each node to know about all other nodes in the network (as in Tor and AN.ON -- the most popular anonymization networks) limits scalability and offers a playground for intersection attacks. The distributed designs existing so far fail to meet security requirements and have therefore not been accepted in real networks."
ACM CCS 2009,Proximity-based access control for implantable medical devices.,"We propose a proximity-based access control scheme for implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our scheme is based on ultrasonic distance-bounding and enables an implanted medical device to grant access to its resources only to those devices that are in its close proximity. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through tests in an emulated patient environment. We show that, although implanted, IMDs can successfully verify the proximity of other devices with high accuracy. We propose a set of protocols that support our scheme, analyze their security in detail and discuss possible extensions. We make new observations about the security of implementations of ultrasonic distance-bounding protocols. Finally, we discuss the integration of our scheme with existing IMD devices and with their existing security measures."
ACM CCS 2009,The fable of the bees - incentivizing robust revocation decision making in ad hoc networks.,In this paper we present a new key-revocation scheme for ad hoc network environments with the following characteristics:
ACM CCS 2009,"Hey, you, get off of my cloud - exploring information leakage in third-party compute clouds.","Third-party cloud computing represents the promise of outsourcing as applied to computation. Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's EC2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on the same machine."
ACM CCS 2009,Secure in-VM monitoring using hardware virtualization.,"Kernel-level attacks or rootkits can compromise the security of an operating system by executing with the privilege of the kernel. Current approaches use virtualization to gain higher privilege over these attacks, and isolate security tools from the untrusted guest VM by moving them out and placing them in a separate trusted VM. Although out-of-VM isolation can help ensure security, the added overhead of world-switches between the guest VMs for each invocation of the monitor makes this approach unsuitable for many applications, especially fine-grained monitoring. In this paper, we present Secure In-VM Monitoring (SIM), a general-purpose framework that enables security monitoring applications to be placed back in the untrusted guest VM for efficiency without sacrificing the security guarantees provided by running them outside of the VM. We utilize contemporary hardware memory protection and hardware virtualization features available in recent processors to create a hypervisor protected address space where a monitor can execute and access data in native speeds and to which execution is transferred in a controlled manner that does not require hypervisor involvement. We have developed a prototype into KVM utilizing Intel VT hardware virtualization technology. We have also developed two representative applications for the Windows OS that monitor system calls and process creations. Our microbenchmarks show at least 10 times performance improvement in invocation of a monitor inside SIM over a monitor residing in another trusted VM. With a systematic security analysis of SIM against a number of possible threats, we show that SIM provides at least the same security guarantees as what can be achieved by out-of-VM monitors."
ACM CCS 2009,Can they hear me now? - a security analysis of law enforcement wiretaps.,"Although modern communications services are susceptible to third-party eavesdropping via a wide range of possible techniques, law enforcement agencies in the US and other countries generally use one of two technologies when they conduct legally-authorized interception of telephones and other communications traffic. The most common of these, designed to comply with the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act(CALEA), use a standard interface provided in network switches."
ACM CCS 2009,A metadata calculus for secure information sharing.,"In both commercial and defense sectors a compelling need is emerging for rapid, yet secure, dissemination of information to the concerned actors. Traditional approaches to information sharing that rely on security labels (e.g., Multi-Level Security (MLS)) suffer from at least two major drawbacks. First, static security labels do not account for tactical information whose value decays over time. Second, MLS-like approaches have often ignored information transform semantics when deducing security labels (e.g., output security label = max over all input security labels). While MLS-like label deduction appears to be conservative, we argue that this approach can result in both underestimation and overestimation of security labels. We contend that overestimation may adversely throttle information flows, while underestimation incites information misuse and leakage."
ACM CCS 2009,Your botnet is my botnet - analysis of a botnet takeover.,"Botnets, networks of malware-infected machines that are controlled by an adversary, are the root cause of a large number of security problems on the Internet. A particularly sophisticated and insidious type of bot is Torpig, a malware program that is designed to harvest sensitive information (such as bank account and credit card data) from its victims. In this paper, we report on our efforts to take control of the Torpig botnet and study its operations for a period of ten days. During this time, we observed more than 180 thousand infections and recorded almost 70 GB of data that the bots collected. While botnets have been ""hijacked"" and studied previously, the Torpig botnet exhibits certain properties that make the analysis of the data particularly interesting. First, it is possible (with reasonable accuracy) to identify unique bot infections and relate that number to the more than 1.2 million IP addresses that contacted our command and control server. Second, the Torpig botnet is large, targets a variety of applications, and gathers a rich and diverse set of data from the infected victims. This data provides a new understanding of the type and amount of personal information that is stolen by botnets."
ACM CCS 2009,On voting machine design for verification and testability.,"We present an approach for the design and analysis of an electronic voting machine based on a novel combination of formal verification and systematic testing. The system was designed specifically to enable verification and testing. In our architecture, the voting machine is a finite-state transducer that implements the bare essentials required for an election. We formally specify how each component of the machine is intended to work and formally verify that a Verilog implementation of our design meets this specification. However, it is more challenging to verify that the composition of these components will behave as a voter would expect, because formalizing human expectations is difficult. We show how systematic testing can be used to address this issue, and in particular to verify that the machine will behave correctly on election day."
ACM CCS 2009,On cellular botnets - measuring the impact of malicious devices on a cellular network core.,"The vast expansion of interconnectivity with the Internet and the rapid evolution of highly-capable but largely insecure mobile devices threatens cellular networks. In this paper, we characterize the impact of the large scale compromise and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a combination of measurement, simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the ability of a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compromised mobile phones to degrade service to area-code sized regions by 93%. As such attacks are accomplished through the execution of network service requests and not a constant stream of phone calls, users are unlikely to be aware of their occurrence. We then investigate a number of significant network bottlenecks, their impact on the density of compromised nodes per base station and how they can be avoided. We conclude by discussing a number of countermeasures that may help to partially mitigate the threats posed by such attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,The bayesian traffic analysis of mix networks.,"This work casts the traffic analysis of anonymity systems, and in particular mix networks, in the context of Bayesian inference. A generative probabilistic model of mix network architectures is presented, that incorporates a number of attack techniques in the traffic analysis literature. We use the model to build an Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference engine, that calculates the probabilities of who is talking to whom given an observation of network traces. We provide a thorough evaluation of its correctness and performance, and confirm that mix networks with realistic parameters are secure. This approach enables us to apply established information theoretic anonymity metrics on complex mix networks, and extract information from anonymised traffic traces optimally."
ACM CCS 2009,Membership-concealing overlay networks.,"We introduce the concept of membership-concealing overlay networks (MCONs), which hide the real-world identities of participants. We argue that while membership concealment is orthogonal to anonymity and censorship resistance, pseudonymous communication and censorship resistance become much easier if done over a membership-concealing network. We formalize the concept of membership concealment, discuss a number of attacks against existing systems and present real-world attack results. We then propose three proof-of-concept MCON designs that resist those attacks: one that is more efficient, another that is more robust to membership churn, and a third that balances efficiency and robustness. We show theoretical and simulation results demonstrating the feasibility and performance of our schemes."
ACM CCS 2009,Ripley - automatically securing web 2.0 applications through replicated execution.,"Rich Internet applications are becoming increasingly distributed, as demonstrated by the popularity of AJAX or Web 2.0 applications such as Facebook, Google Maps, Hotmail and many others. A typical multi-tier AJAX application consists, at least, of a server-side component implemented in Java J2EE, PHP or ASP.NET and a client-side component running JavaScript. The resulting application is more responsive because computation has moved closer to the client, avoiding unnecessary network round trips for frequent user actions."
ACM CCS 2009,Countering kernel rootkits with lightweight hook protection.,"Kernel rootkits have posed serious security threats due to their stealthy manner. To hide their presence and activities, many rootkits hijack control flows by modifying control data or hooks in the kernel space. A critical step towards eliminating rootkits is to protect such hooks from being hijacked. However, it remains a challenge because there exist a large number of widely-scattered kernel hooks and many of them could be dynamically allocated from kernel heap and co-located together with other kernel data. In addition, there is a lack of flexible commodity hardware support, leading to the socalled protection granularity gap -- kernel hook protection requires byte-level granularity but commodity hardware only provides page level protection."
ACM CCS 2009,Behavior based software theft detection.,"Along with the burst of open source projects, software theft (or plagiarism) has become a very serious threat to the healthiness of software industry. Software birthmark, which represents the unique characteristics of a program, can be used for software theft detection. We propose a system call dependence graph based software birthmark called SCDG birthmark, and examine how well it reflects unique behavioral characteristics of a program. To our knowledge, our detection system based on SCDG birthmark is the first one that is capable of detecting software component theft where only partial code is stolen. We demonstrate the strength of our birthmark against various evasion techniques, including those based on different compilers and different compiler optimization levels as well as two state-of-the-art obfuscation tools. Unlike the existing work that were evaluated through small or toy software, we also evaluate our birthmark on a set of large software. Our results show that SCDG birthmark is very practical and effective in detecting software theft that even adopts advanced evasion techniques."
ACM CCS 2009,Learning your identity and disease from research papers - information leaks in genome wide association study.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim at discovering the association between genetic variations, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and common diseases, which is well recognized to be one of the most important and active areas in biomedical research. Also renowned is the privacy implication of such studies, which has been brought into the limelight by the recent attack proposed by Homer et al. Homer's attack demonstrates that it is possible to identify a GWAS participant from the allele frequencies of a large number of SNPs. Such a threat, unfortunately, was found in our research to be significantly understated. In this paper, we show that individuals can actually be identified from even a relatively small set of statistics, as those routinely published in GWAS papers. We present two attacks. The first one extends Homer's attack with a much more powerful test statistic, based on the correlations among different SNPs described by coefficient of determination (r2). This attack can determine the presence of an individual from the statistics related to a couple of hundred SNPs. The second attack can lead to complete disclosure of hundreds of participants' SNPs, through analyzing the information derived from published statistics. We also found that those attacks can succeed even when the precisions of the statistics are low and part of data is missing. We evaluated our attacks on the real human genomes and concluded that such threats are completely realistic."
ACM CCS 2009,Privacy-preserving genomic computation through program specialization.,"In this paper, we present a new approach to performing important classes of genomic computations (e.g., search for homologous genes) that makes a significant step towards privacy protection in this domain. Our approach leverages a key property of the human genome, namely that the vast majority of it is shared across humans (and hence public), and consequently relatively little of it is sensitive. Based on this observation, we propose a privacy-protection framework that partitions a genomic computation, distributing the part on sensitive data to the data provider and the part on the pubic data to the user of the data. Such a partition is achieved through program specialization that enables a biocomputing program to perform a concrete execution on public data and a symbolic execution on sensitive data. As a result, the program is simplified into an efficient query program that takes only sensitive genetic data as inputs. We prove the effectiveness of our techniques on a set of dynamic programming algorithms common in genomic computing. We develop a program transformation tool that automatically instruments a legacy program for specialization operations. We also demonstrate that our techniques can greatly facilitate secure multi-party computations on large biocomputing problems."
ACM CCS 2009,Feeling-based location privacy protection for location-based services.,"Anonymous location information may be correlated with restricted spaces such as home and office for subject re-identification. This makes it a great challenge to provide location privacy protection for users of location-based services. Existing work adopts traditional K-anonymity model and ensures that each location disclosed in service requests is a spatial region that has been visited by at least K users. This strategy requires a user to specify an appropriate value of K in order to achieve a desired level of privacy protection. This is problematic because privacy is about feeling, and it is awkward for one to scale her feeling using a number. In this paper, we propose a feeling-based privacy model. The model allows a user to express her privacy requirement by specifying a public region, which the user would feel comfortable if the region is reported as her location. The popularity of the public region, measured using entropy based on its visitors' footprints inside it, is then used as the user's desired level of privacy protection. With this model in place, we present a novel technique that allows a user's location information to be reported as accurate as possible while providing her sufficient location privacy protection. The new technique supports trajectory cloaking and can be used in application scenarios where a user needs to make frequent location updates along a trajectory that cannot be predicted. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed technique under various conditions through simulation, we have also implemented an experimental system for location privacy-aware uses of location-based services."
ACM CCS 2009,Filter-resistant code injection on ARM.,"Code injections attacks are one of the most powerful and important classes of attacks on software. In such attacks, the attacker sends malicious input to a software application, where it is stored in memory. The malicious input is chosen in such a way that its representation in memory is also a valid representation of a machine code program that performs actions chosen by the attacker. The attacker then triggers a bug in the application to divert the control flow to this injected machine code. A typical action of the injected code is to launch a command interpreter shell, and hence the malicious input is often called shellcode."

ACM CCS 2009,Attacking cryptographic schemes based on &quot;perturbation polynomials&quot;.,"We show attacks on several cryptographic schemes that have recently been proposed for achieving various security goals in sensor networks. Roughly speaking, these schemes all use ""perturbation polynomials"" to add ""noise"" to polynomialbased systems that offer information-theoretic security, in an attempt to increase the resilience threshold while maintaining efficiency. We show that the heuristic security arguments given for these modified schemes do not hold, and that they can be completely broken once we allow even a slight extension of the parameters beyond those achieved by the underlying information-theoretic schemes."
ACM CCS 2009,On achieving good operating points on an ROC plane using stochastic anomaly score prediction.,"ROC curves have historically been used to evaluate the accuracy of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs). In this paper, we argue that a real-time IDS' input changes considerably over time and ROC curves generated using fixed, time-invariant classification thresholds do not characterize the best accuracy that an IDS can achieve. To address this problem, we propose a simple, generic and adaptive technique to achieve good ROC operating points for any given IDS. The proposed technique stochastically predicts the next anomaly score of an IDS and the anomaly classification threshold is then set as a function of the predicted score. We first perform statistical and information-theoretic analyses of network- and host-based IDSs' anomaly scores to reveal a consistent time correlation structure during benign activity periods. We model the observed correlation structure using Markov chains and then use this model to predict and adapt an IDS' classification threshold. The proposed adaptive thresholding module is incorporated into six prominent network- and host-based Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs). These adaptive ADSs are evaluated on public and labeled attack datasets. We show that, while reducing the need for manual threshold configuration and having very low-complexity, adaptive thresholding enables the ADSs to achieve considerably higher accuracies on the ROC plane."
ACM CCS 2009,CoSP - a general framework for computational soundness proofs.,"We describe CoSP, a general framework for conducting computational soundness proofs of symbolic models and for embedding these proofs into formal calculi. CoSP considers arbitrary equational theories and computational implementations, and it abstracts away many details that are not crucial for proving computational soundness, such as message scheduling, corruption models, and even the internal structure of a protocol. CoSP enables soundness results, in the sense of preservation of trace properties, to be proven in a conceptually modular and generic way: proving x cryptographic primitives sound for y calculi only requires x + y proofs (instead of x • y proofs without this framework), and the process of embedding calculi is conceptually decoupled from computational soundness proofs of cryptographic primitives. We exemplify the usefulness of CoSP by proving the first computational soundness result for the full-fledged applied π-calculus under active attacks. Concretely, we embed the applied π-calculus into CoSP and give a sound implementation of public-key encryption and digital signatures."
ACM CCS 2009,An efficient forward private RFID protocol.,"Radio Frequency IDentifiers (RFID) are low-cost pervasive devices used in various settings for identification purposes: although they have originally been introduced to ease the supply chain management, they are already used in many other applications. Some of these applications need secure identification and ad-hoc authentication protocols have to be designed for that purpose. But the intrusion of RFID in the life of end-users might additionally require a higher level of user-privacy. Such security and privacy requirements conflict with the highly constrained environment of RFID systems. Ohkubo, Suzuki, and Kinoshita first proposed an appealing RFID protocol that meets the highest privacy requirements. However, their scheme and its known variants suffer from limitations in terms of computational complexity and provable security which this paper aims to address. We propose a novel forward private authentication scheme built upon less computationally expensive cryptographic ingredients, namely pseudo-random generators and universal hash functions instead of one way hash functions. In contrast with existing schemes, we provide security proofs of our construction in the standard model instead of the random oracle model."
ACM CCS 2009,Anonymous credentials on a standard java card.,"Secure identity tokens such as Electronic Identity (eID) cards are emerging everywhere. At the same time user-centric identity management gains acceptance. Anonymous credential schemes are the optimal realization of user-centricity. However, on inexpensive hardware platforms, typically used for eID cards, these schemes could not be made to meet the necessary requirements such as future-proof key lengths and transaction times on the order of 10 seconds. The reasons for this is the need for the hardware platform to be standardized and certified. Therefore an implementation is only possible as a Java Card applet. This results in severe restrictions: little memory (transient and persistent), an 8-bit CPU, and access to hardware acceleration for cryptographic operations only by defined interfaces such as RSA encryption operations."
ACM CCS 2009,Reactive noninterference.,"Many programs operate reactively--patiently waiting for user input, running for a while producing output, and eventually returning to a state where they are ready to accept another input (or occasionally diverging). When a reactive program communicates with multiple parties, we would like to be sure that it can be given secret information by one without leaking it to others."
ACM CCS 2009,XCS - cross channel scripting and its impact on web applications.,"We study the security of embedded web servers used in consumer electronic devices, such as security cameras and photo frames, and for IT infrastructure, such as wireless access points and lights-out management systems. All the devices we examine turn out to be vulnerable to a variety of web attacks, including cross site scripting (XSS) and cross site request forgery (CSRF). In addition, we show that consumer electronics are particularly vulnerable to a nasty form of persistent XSS where a non-web channel such as NFS or SNMP is used to inject a malicious script. This script is later used to attack an unsuspecting user who connects to the device's web server. We refer to web attacks which are mounted through a non-web channel as cross channel scripting (XCS). We propose a client-side defense against certain XCS which we implement as a browser extension."
ACM CCS 2009,HAIL - a high-availability and integrity layer for cloud storage.,"We introduce HAIL (High-Availability and Integrity Layer), a distributed cryptographic system that allows a set of servers to prove to a client that a stored file is intact and retrievable. HAIL strengthens, formally unifies, and streamlines distinct approaches from the cryptographic and distributed-systems communities. Proofs in HAIL are efficiently computable by servers and highly compact---typically tens or hundreds of bytes, irrespective of file size. HAIL cryptographically verifies and reactively reallocates file shares. It is robust against an active, mobile adversary, i.e., one that may progressively corrupt the full set of servers. We propose a strong, formal adversarial model for HAIL, and rigorous analysis and parameter choices. We show how HAIL improves on the security and efficiency of existing tools, like Proofs of Retrievability (PORs) deployed on individual servers. We also report on a prototype implementation."
ACM CCS 2009,Dispatcher - enabling active botnet infiltration using automatic protocol reverse-engineering.,"Automatic protocol reverse-engineering is important for many security applications, including the analysis and defense against botnets. Understanding the command-and-control (C&C) protocol used by a botnet is crucial for anticipating its repertoire of nefarious activity and to enable active botnet infiltration. Frequently, security analysts need to rewrite messages sent and received by a bot in order to contain malicious activity and to provide the botmaster with an illusion of successful and unhampered operation. To enable such rewriting, we need detailed information about the intent and structure of the messages in both directions of the communication despite the fact that we generally only have access to the implementation of one endpoint, namely the bot binary. Current techniques cannot enable such rewriting. In this paper, we propose techniques to extract the format of protocol messages sent by an application that implements a protocol specification, and to infer the field semantics for messages both sent and received by the application. Our techniques enable applications such as rewriting the C&C messages for active botnet infiltration. We implement our techniques into Dispatcher, a tool to extract the message format and field semantics of both received and sent messages. We use Dispatcher to analyze MegaD, a prevalent spam botnet employing a hitherto undocumented C&C protocol, and show that the protocol information extracted by Dispatcher can be used to rewrite the C&C messages."
ACM CCS 2009,Oblivious transfer with access control.,"We present a protocol for anonymous access to a database where the different records have different access control permissions. These permissions could be attributes, roles, or rights that the user needs to have in order to access the record. Our protocol offers maximal security guarantees for both the database and the user, namely (1) only authorized users can access the record; (2) the database provider does not learn which record the user accesses; and (3) the database provider does not learn which attributes or roles the user has when she accesses the database."
ACM CCS 2009,Mapping kernel objects to enable systematic integrity checking.,"Dynamic kernel data have become an attractive target for kernel-mode malware. However, previous solutions for checking kernel integrity either limit themselves to code and static data or can only inspect a fraction of dynamic data, resulting in limited protection. Our study shows that previous solutions may reach only 28% of the dynamic kernel data and thus may fail to identify function pointers manipulated by many kernel-mode malware."
ACM CCS 2009,On the difficulty of software-based attestation of embedded devices.,"Device attestation is an essential feature in many security protocols and applications. The lack of dedicated hardware and the impossibility to physically access devices to be attested, makes attestation of embedded devices, in applications such as Wireless Sensor Networks, a prominent challenge. Several software-based attestation techniques have been proposed that either rely on tight time constraints or on the lack of free space to store malicious code. This paper investigates the shortcomings of existing software-based attestation techniques. We first present two generic attacks, one based on a return-oriented rootkit} and the other on code compression. We further describe specific attacks on two existing proposals, namely SWATT and ICE-based schemes, and argue about the difficulty of fixing them. All attacks presented in this paper were implemented and validated on commodity sensors."
ACM CCS 2009,Certificateless onion routing.,"Onion routing protocols allow users to establish anonymous channels to preserve their privacy over a public network. Several protocols implementing this primitive have been proposed in recent years, and TOR, a real-life implementation, provides an onion routing service to thousands of users over the internet."
ACM CCS 2009,Improving privacy and security in multi-authority attribute-based encryption.,"Attribute based encryption (ABE) [13] determines decryption ability based on a user's attributes. In a multi-authority ABE scheme, multiple attribute-authorities monitor different sets of attributes and issue corresponding decryption keys to users, and encryptors can require that a user obtain keys for appropriate attributes from each authority before decrypting a message. Chase [5] gave a multi-authority ABE scheme using the concepts of a trusted central authority (CA) and global identifiers (GID). However, the CA in that construction has the power to decrypt every ciphertext, which seems somehow contradictory to the original goal of distributing control over many potentially untrusted authorities. Moreover, in that construction, the use of a consistent GID allowed the authorities to combine their information to build a full profile with all of a user's attributes, which unnecessarily compromises the privacy of the user. In this paper, we propose a solution which removes the trusted central authority, and protects the users' privacy by preventing the authorities from pooling their information on particular users, thus making ABE more usable in practice."
ACM CCS 2009,Multiple password interference in text passwords and click-based graphical passwords.,"The underlying issues relating to the usability and security of multiple passwords are largely unexplored. However, we know that people generally have difficulty remembering multiple passwords. This reduces security since users reuse the same password for different systems or reveal other passwords as they try to log in. We report on a laboratory study comparing recall of multiple text passwords with recall of multiple click-based graphical passwords. In a one-hour session (short-term), we found that participants in the graphical password condition coped significantly better than those in the text password condition. In particular, they made fewer errors when recalling their passwords, did not resort to creating passwords directly related to account names, and did not use similar passwords across multiple accounts. After two weeks, participants in the two conditions had recall success rates that were not statistically different from each other, but those with text passwords made more recall errors than participants with graphical passwords. In our study, click-based graphical passwords were significantly less susceptible to multiple password interference in the short-term, while having comparable usability to text passwords in most other respects."
ACM CCS 2009,Robust signatures for kernel data structures.,"Kernel-mode rootkits hide objects such as processes and threads using a technique known as Direct Kernel Object Manipulation (DKOM). Many forensic analysis tools attempt to detect these hidden objects by scanning kernel memory with handmade signatures; however, such signatures are brittle and rely on non-essential features of these data structures, making them easy to evade. In this paper, we present an automated mechanism for generating signatures for kernel data structures and show that these signatures are robust: attempts to evade the signature by modifying the structure contents will cause the OS to consider the object invalid. Using dynamic analysis, we profile the target data structure to determine commonly used fields, and we then fuzz those fields to determine which are essential to the correct operation of the OS. These fields form the basis of a signature for the data structure. In our experiments, our new signature matched the accuracy of existing scanners for traditional malware and found processes hidden with our prototype rootkit that all current signatures missed. Our techniques significantly increase the difficulty of hiding objects from signature scanning."
ACM CCS 2009,As-awareness in Tor path selection.,"Tor is an anonymous communications network with thousands of router nodes worldwide. An intuition reflected in much of the literature on anonymous communications is that, as an anonymity network grows, it becomes more secure against a given observer because the observer will see less of the network. In particular, as the Tor network grows from volunteers operating relays all over the world, it becomes less and less likely for a single autonomous system (AS) to be able to observe both ends of an anonymous connection. Yet, as the network continues to grow significantly, no analysis has been done to determine if this intuition is correct. Further, modifications to Tor's path selection algorithm to help clients avoid an AS-level observer have not been proposed and analyzed."
ACM CCS 2009,On lightweight mobile phone application certification.,"Users have begun downloading an increasingly large number of mobile phone applications in response to advancements in handsets and wireless networks. The increased number of applications results in a greater chance of installing Trojans and similar malware. In this paper, we propose the Kirin security service for Android, which performs lightweight certification of applications to mitigate malware at install time. Kirin certification uses security rules, which are templates designed to conservatively match undesirable properties in security configuration bundled with applications. We use a variant of security requirements engineering techniques to perform an in-depth security analysis of Android to produce a set of rules that match malware characteristics. In a sample of 311 of the most popular applications downloaded from the official Android Market, Kirin and our rules found 5 applications that implement dangerous functionality and therefore should be installed with extreme caution. Upon close inspection, another five applications asserted dangerous rights, but were within the scope of reasonable functional needs. These results indicate that security configuration bundled with Android applications provides practical means of detecting malware."
ACM CCS 2009,Dynamic provable data possession.,"We consider the problem of efficiently proving the integrity of data stored at untrusted servers. In the provable data possession (PDP) model, the client preprocesses the data and then sends it to an untrusted server for storage, while keeping a small amount of meta-data. The client later asks the server to prove that the stored data has not been tampered with or deleted (without downloading the actual data). However, the original PDP scheme applies only to static (or append-only) files."
ACM CCS 2009,A security-preserving compiler for distributed programs - from information-flow policies to cryptographic mechanisms.,"We enforce information flow policies in programs that run at multiple locations, with diverse levels of security."
ACM CCS 2009,A probabilistic approach to hybrid role mining.,"Role mining algorithms address an important access control problem: configuring a role-based access control system. Given a direct assignment of users to permissions, role mining discovers a set of roles together with an assignment of users to roles. The results should closely agree with the direct assignment. Moreover, the roles should be understandable from the business perspective in that they reflect functional roles within the enterprise. This requires hybrid role mining methods that work with both direct assignments and business information from the enterprise."
ACM CCS 2009,On non-cooperative location privacy - a game-theoretic analysis.,"In mobile networks, authentication is a required primitive for the majority of security protocols. However, an adversary can track the location of mobile nodes by monitoring pseudonyms used for authentication. A frequently proposed solution to protect location privacy suggests that mobile nodes collectively change their pseudonyms in regions called mix zones. Because this approach is costly, self-interested mobile nodes might decide not to cooperate and could thus jeopardize the achievable location privacy. In this paper, we analyze the non-cooperative behavior of mobile nodes by using a game-theoretic model, where each player aims at maximizing its location privacy at a minimum cost. We first analyze the Nash equilibria in n-player complete information games. Because mobile nodes in a privacy-sensitive system do not know their opponents' payoffs, we then consider incomplete information games. We establish that symmetric Bayesian-Nash equilibria exist with simple threshold strategies in n-player games and derive the equilibrium strategies. By means of numerical results, we show that mobile nodes become selfish when the cost of changing pseudonyms is small, whereas they cooperate more when the cost of changing pseudonyms increases. Finally, we design a protocol - the PseudoGame protocol - based on the results of our analysis."
ACM CCS 2009,Battle of Botcraft - fighting bots in online games with human observational proofs.,"The abuse of online games by automated programs, known as game bots, for gaining unfair advantages has plagued millions of participating players with escalating severity in recent years. The current methods for distinguishing bots and humans are based on human interactive proofs (HIPs), such as CAPTCHAs. However, HIP-based approaches have inherent drawbacks. In particular, they are too obtrusive to be tolerated by human players in a gaming context. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive approach based on human observational proofs (HOPs) for continuous game bot detection. HOPs differentiate bots from human players by passively monitoring input actions that are difficult for current bots to perform in a human-like manner. We collect a series of user-input traces in one of the most popular online games, World of Warcraft. Based on the traces, we characterize the game playing behaviors of bots and humans. Then, we develop a HOP-based game bot defense system that analyzes user-input actions with a cascade-correlation neural network to distinguish bots from humans. The HOP system is effective in capturing current game bots, which raises the bar against game exploits and forces a determined adversary to build more complicated game bots for detection evasion in the future."
ACM CCS 2009,Multi-party off-the-record messaging.,"Most cryptographic algorithms provide a means for secret and authentic communication. However, under many circumstances, the ability to repudiate messages or deny a conversation is no less important than secrecy and authenticity. For whistleblowers, informants, political dissidents and journalists --- to name a few --- it is most important to have means for deniable conversation, where electronic communication must mimic face-to-face private meetings. Off-the-Record Messaging, proposed in 2004 by Borisov, Goldberg and Brewer, and its subsequent improvements, simulate private two-party meetings. Despite some attempts, the multi-party scenario remains unresolved."
ACM CCS 2009,Large-scale malware indexing using function-call graphs.,"A major challenge of the anti-virus (AV) industry is how to effectively process the huge influx of malware samples they receive every day. One possible solution to this problem is to quickly determine if a new malware sample is similar to any previously-seen malware program. In this paper, we design, implement and evaluate a malware database management system called SMIT (Symantec Malware Indexing Tree) that can efficiently make such determination based on malware's function-call graphs, which is a structural representation known to be less susceptible to instruction-level obfuscations commonly employed by malware writers to evade detection of AV software. Because each malware program is represented as a graph, the problem of searching for the most similar malware program in a database to a given malware sample is cast into a nearest-neighbor search problem in a graph database. To speed up this search, we have developed an efficient method to compute graph similarity that exploits structural and instruction-level information in the underlying malware programs, and a multi-resolution indexing scheme that uses a computationally economical feature vector for early pruning and resorts to a more accurate but computationally more expensive graph similarity function only when it needs to pinpoint the most similar neighbors. Results of a comprehensive performance study of the SMIT prototype using a database of more than 100,000 malware demonstrate the effective pruning power and scalability of its nearest neighbor search mechanisms."
ACM CCS 2009,Fides - remote anomaly-based cheat detection using client emulation.,"As a result of physically owning the client machine, cheaters in online games currently have the upper-hand when it comes to avoiding detection. To address this problem and turn the table on cheaters, this paper presents Fides, an anomaly-based cheat detection approach that remotely validates game execution. With Fides, a server-side Controller specifies how and when a client-side Auditor measures the game. To accurately validate measurements, the Controller partially emulates the client and collaborates with the server. This paper examines a range of cheat methods and initial measurements that counter them, showing that a Fides prototype is able to efficiently detect several existing cheats, including one state-of-the-art cheat that is advertised as ""undetectable""."
ACM CCS 2009,"EPC RFID tag security weaknesses and defenses - passport cards, enhanced drivers licenses, and beyond.","EPC (Electronic Product Code) tags are industry-standard RFID devices poised to supplant optical barcodes in many applications. We explore the systemic risks and challenges created by the increasingly common use of EPC for security applications. As a central case study, we examine the recently issued United States Passport Card and Washington State ""enhanced drivers license"" (WA EDL), both of which incorporate Gen-2 EPC tags. We measure multiple weaknesses, including susceptibility to cloning, extended read ranges, and the ability to remotely kill a WA EDL. We study the implications of these vulnerabilities to overall system security, and offer suggestions for improvement. We demonstrate anti-cloning techniques for off-the-shelf EPC tags, overcoming practical challenges in a previous proposal to co-opt the EPC ""kill"" command to achieve tag authentication. Our paper fills a vacuum of experimentally grounded evaluation of and guidance for security applications for EPC tags not just in identity documents, but more broadly in the authentication of objects and people."
ACM CCS 2009,Computational soundness for key exchange protocols with symmetric encryption.,"Formal analysis of security protocols based on symbolic models has been very successful in finding flaws in published protocols and proving protocols secure, using automated tools. An important question is whether this kind of formal analysis implies security guarantees in the strong sense of modern cryptography. Initiated by the seminal work of Abadi and Rogaway, this question has been investigated and numerous positive results showing this so-called computational soundness of formal analysis have been obtained. However, for the case of active adversaries and protocols that use symmetric encryption computational soundness has remained a challenge."
ACM CCS 2009,Efficient pseudorandom functions from the decisional linear assumption and weaker variants.,"In this paper, we generalize Naor and Reingold's construction of pseudorandom functions under the DDH Assumption [22] to yield a construction of pseudorandom functions under the decisional k-Linear Assumption, for each k › 1. The decisional Linear Assumption was first introduced by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham in [5] as an alternative assumption for settings where the DDH problem is easy, such as bilinear groups. Shacham [25] and Hofheinz and Kiltz [16] independently introduced the generalized decisional k-Linear Assumptions and showed that the decisional (k+1)-Linear problem is hard for generic groups even when the decisional k-Linear problem is easy. It is thus desirable to have constructions of cryptographic primitives based on the decisional k-Linear Assumption instead of DDH. Not surprisingly, one must pay a small price for added security: as k increases, our constructed functions become slightly less efficient to compute and the key size increases (quadratically in k)."
ACM CCS 2009,Finding bugs in exceptional situations of JNI programs.,"Software flaws in native methods may defeat Java's guarantees of safety and security. One common kind of flaws in native methods results from the discrepancy on how exceptions are handled in Java and in native methods. Unlike exceptions in Java, exceptions raised in the native code through the Java Native Interface (JNI) are not controlled by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Only after the native code finishes execution will the JVM's mechanism for exceptions take over. This discrepancy makes handling of JNI exceptions an error prone process and can cause serious security flaws in software written using the JNI."
ACM CCS 2009,A new cell counter based attack against tor.,"Various low-latency anonymous communication systems such as Tor and Anoymizer have been designed to provide anonymity service for users. In order to hide the communication of users, many anonymity systems pack the application data into equal-sized cells (e.g., 512 bytes for Tor, a known real-world, circuit-based low-latency anonymous communication network). In this paper, we investigate a new cell counter based attack against Tor, which allows the attacker to confirm anonymous communication relationship among users very quickly. In this attack, by marginally varying the counter of cells in the target traffic at the malicious exit onion router, the attacker can embed a secret signal into the variation of cell counter of the target traffic. The embedded signal will be carried along with the target traffic and arrive at the malicious entry onion router. Then an accomplice of the attacker at the malicious entry onion router will detect the embedded signal based on the received cells and confirm the communication relationship among users. We have implemented this attack against Tor and our experimental data validate its feasibility and effectiveness. There are several unique features of this attack. First, this attack is highly efficient and can confirm very short communication sessions with only tens of cells. Second, this attack is effective and its detection rate approaches 100% with a very low false positive rate. Third, it is possible to implement the attack in a way that appears to be very difficult for honest participants to detect (e.g. using our hopping-based signal embedding)."
ACM CCS 2009,False data injection attacks against state estimation in electric power grids.,"A power grid is a complex system connecting electric power generators to consumers through power transmission and distribution networks across a large geographical area. System monitoring is necessary to ensure the reliable operation of power grids, and state estimation is used in system monitoring to best estimate the power grid state through analysis of meter measurements and power system models. Various techniques have been developed to detect and identify bad measurements, including the interacting bad measurements introduced by arbitrary, non-random causes. At first glance, it seems that these techniques can also defeat malicious measurements injected by attackers."
ACM CCS 2009,"RFID privacy - relation between two notions, minimal condition, and efficient construction.","Privacy of RFID systems is receiving increasing attention in the RFID community. Basically, there are two kinds of RFID privacy notions: one based on the indistinguishability of two tags, denoted as ind-privacy, and the other based on the unpredictability of the output of a protocol, denoted as unp-privacy. In this paper, the definition of unp-privacy is refined and the relation between the two notions is clarified: it is proven that ind-privacy is weaker than unp-privacy. Moreover, the minimal (necessary and sufficient)condition on RFID tags to achieve unp-privacy is determined. It is shown that if an RFID system has strong (or weak) unp-privacy then the computational power of an RFID tag can be used to construct a pseudorandom function family provided that the RFID system is complete and sound. On the other hand, if each tag is able to compute a pseudorandom function, then the tags can be used to construct an RFID system with strong (or weak) unp-privacy. In this sense, a pseudorandom function family is the minimal requirement on an RFID tag's computational power for enforcing strong RFID system privacy. Finally, a new RFID protocol is proposed to satisfy the minimal requirement, which also outperforms the state-of-the-art RFID protocols in terms of computational cost and communication overhead."
ACM CCS 2009,SMILE - encounter-based trust for mobile social services.,"Conventional mobile social services such as Loopt and Google Latitude rely on two classes of trusted relationships: participants trust a centralized server to manage their location information and trust between users is based on existing social relationships. Unfortunately, these assumptions are not secure or general enough for many mobile social scenarios: centralized servers cannot always be relied upon to preserve data confidentiality, and users may want to use mobile social services to establish new relationships. To address these shortcomings, this paper describes SMILE, a privacy-preserving ""missed-connections"" service in which the service provider is untrusted and users are not assumed to have pre-established social relationships with each other. At a high-level, SMILE uses short-range wireless communication and standard cryptographic primitives to mimic the behavior of users in existing missed-connections services such as Craigslist: trust is founded solely on anonymous users' ability to prove to each other that they shared an encounter in the past. We have evaluated SMILE using protocol analysis, an informal study of Craigslist usage, and experiments with a prototype implementation and found it to be both privacy-preserving and feasible."
ACM CCS 2009,English shellcode.,"History indicates that the security community commonly takes a divide-and-conquer approach to battling malware threats: identify the essential and inalienable components of an attack, then develop detection and prevention techniques that directly target one or more of the essential components. This abstraction is evident in much of the literature for buffer overflow attacks including, for instance, stack protection and NOP sled detection. It comes as no surprise then that we approach shellcode detection and prevention in a similar fashion. However, the common belief that components of polymorphic shellcode (e.g., the decoder) cannot reliably be hidden suggests a more implicit and broader assumption that continues to drive contemporary research: namely, that valid and complete representations of shellcode are fundamentally different in structure than benign payloads. While the first tenet of this assumption is philosophically undeniable (i.e., a string of bytes is either shellcode or it is not), truth of the latter claim is less obvious if there exist encoding techniques capable of producing shellcode with features nearly indistinguishable from non-executable content. In this paper, we challenge the assumption that shellcode must conform to superficial and discernible representations. Specifically, we demonstrate a technique for automatically producing English Shellcode, transforming arbitrary shellcode into a representation that is superficially similar to English prose. The shellcode is completely self-contained---i.e., it does not require an external loader and executes as valid IA32 code)---and can typically be generated in under an hour on commodity hardware. Our primary objective in this paper is to promote discussion and stimulate new ideas for thinking ahead about preventive measures for tackling evolutions in code-injection attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,Scalable onion routing with torsk.,"We introduce Torsk, a structured peer-to-peer low-latency anonymity protocol. Torsk is designed as an interoperable replacement for the relay selection and directory service of the popular Tor anonymity network, that decreases the bandwidth cost of relay selection and maintenance from quadratic to quasilinear while introducing no new attacks on the anonymity provided by Tor, and no additional delay to connections made via Tor. The resulting bandwidth savings make a modest-sized Torsk network significantly cheaper to operate, and allows low-bandwidth clients to join the network."
ACM CCS 2009,Secure open source collaboration - an empirical study of linus&apos; law.,"Open source software is often considered to be secure. One factor in this confidence in the security of open source software lies in leveraging large developer communities to find vulnerabilities in the code. Eric Raymond declares Linus' Law ""Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow."" Does Linus' Law hold up ad infinitum? Or, can the multitude of developers become ""too many cooks in the kitchen"", causing the system's security to suffer as a result? In this study, we examine the security of an open source project in the context of developer collaboration. By analyzing version control logs, we quantified notions of Linus' Law as well as the ""too many cooks in the kitchen"" viewpoint into developer activity metrics. We performed an empirical case study by examining correlations between the known security vulnerabilities in the open source Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 kernel and developer activity metrics. Files developed by otherwise-independent developer groups were more likely to have a vulnerability, supporting Linus' Law. However, files with changes from nine or more developers were 16 times more likely to have a vulnerability than files changed by fewer than nine developers, indicating that many developers changing code may have a detrimental effect on the system's security."
ACM CCS 2009,ShadowWalker - peer-to-peer anonymous communication using redundant structured topologies.,"Peer-to-peer approaches to anonymous communication promise to eliminate the scalability concerns and central vulnerability points of current networks such as Tor. However, the P2P setting introduces many new opportunities for attack, and previous designs do not provide an adequate level of anonymity. We propose ShadowWalker: a new low-latency P2P anonymous communication system, based on a random walk over a redundant structured topology. We base our design on shadows that redundantly check and certify neighbor information; these certifications enable nodes to perform random walks over the structured topology while avoiding route capture and other attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,Effective implementation of the cell broadband engineTM isolation loader.,"This paper presents the design and implementation of the Cell Broadband Engine TM(Cell/B.E.) isolation loader which is a part of the IBM Software Development Kit for Multicore Acceleration [14]. Our isolation loader is a key component in realizing secure application boot and encrypted application execution. During the application load process, the isolation loader fetches, validates, and decrypts a Synergistic Processor Element (SPE) executable, establishing a chain of trust from the hardware to the application. Since not all applications are SPE executables, we also introduce a general solution. This is a verification service framework in which all applications including system functions can be verified by the isolation loader immediately before execution."
ACM CCS 2009,NISAN - network information service for anonymization networks.,"Network information distribution is a fundamental service for any anonymization network. Even though anonymization and information distribution about the network are two orthogonal issues, the design of the distribution service has a direct impact on the anonymization. Requiring each node to know about all other nodes in the network (as in Tor and AN.ON -- the most popular anonymization networks) limits scalability and offers a playground for intersection attacks. The distributed designs existing so far fail to meet security requirements and have therefore not been accepted in real networks."
ACM CCS 2009,Proximity-based access control for implantable medical devices.,"We propose a proximity-based access control scheme for implantable medical devices (IMDs). Our scheme is based on ultrasonic distance-bounding and enables an implanted medical device to grant access to its resources only to those devices that are in its close proximity. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through tests in an emulated patient environment. We show that, although implanted, IMDs can successfully verify the proximity of other devices with high accuracy. We propose a set of protocols that support our scheme, analyze their security in detail and discuss possible extensions. We make new observations about the security of implementations of ultrasonic distance-bounding protocols. Finally, we discuss the integration of our scheme with existing IMD devices and with their existing security measures."

ACM CCS 2009,"Hey, you, get off of my cloud - exploring information leakage in third-party compute clouds.","Third-party cloud computing represents the promise of outsourcing as applied to computation. Services, such as Microsoft's Azure and Amazon's EC2, allow users to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on demand and thus purchase precisely the capacity they require when they require it. In turn, the use of virtualization allows third-party cloud providers to maximize the utilization of their sunk capital costs by multiplexing many customer VMs across a shared physical infrastructure. However, in this paper, we show that this approach can also introduce new vulnerabilities. Using the Amazon EC2 service as a case study, we show that it is possible to map the internal cloud infrastructure, identify where a particular target VM is likely to reside, and then instantiate new VMs until one is placed co-resident with the target. We explore how such placement can then be used to mount cross-VM side-channel attacks to extract information from a target VM on the same machine."
ACM CCS 2009,Secure in-VM monitoring using hardware virtualization.,"Kernel-level attacks or rootkits can compromise the security of an operating system by executing with the privilege of the kernel. Current approaches use virtualization to gain higher privilege over these attacks, and isolate security tools from the untrusted guest VM by moving them out and placing them in a separate trusted VM. Although out-of-VM isolation can help ensure security, the added overhead of world-switches between the guest VMs for each invocation of the monitor makes this approach unsuitable for many applications, especially fine-grained monitoring. In this paper, we present Secure In-VM Monitoring (SIM), a general-purpose framework that enables security monitoring applications to be placed back in the untrusted guest VM for efficiency without sacrificing the security guarantees provided by running them outside of the VM. We utilize contemporary hardware memory protection and hardware virtualization features available in recent processors to create a hypervisor protected address space where a monitor can execute and access data in native speeds and to which execution is transferred in a controlled manner that does not require hypervisor involvement. We have developed a prototype into KVM utilizing Intel VT hardware virtualization technology. We have also developed two representative applications for the Windows OS that monitor system calls and process creations. Our microbenchmarks show at least 10 times performance improvement in invocation of a monitor inside SIM over a monitor residing in another trusted VM. With a systematic security analysis of SIM against a number of possible threats, we show that SIM provides at least the same security guarantees as what can be achieved by out-of-VM monitors."
ACM CCS 2009,Can they hear me now? - a security analysis of law enforcement wiretaps.,"Although modern communications services are susceptible to third-party eavesdropping via a wide range of possible techniques, law enforcement agencies in the US and other countries generally use one of two technologies when they conduct legally-authorized interception of telephones and other communications traffic. The most common of these, designed to comply with the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act(CALEA), use a standard interface provided in network switches."
ACM CCS 2009,A metadata calculus for secure information sharing.,"In both commercial and defense sectors a compelling need is emerging for rapid, yet secure, dissemination of information to the concerned actors. Traditional approaches to information sharing that rely on security labels (e.g., Multi-Level Security (MLS)) suffer from at least two major drawbacks. First, static security labels do not account for tactical information whose value decays over time. Second, MLS-like approaches have often ignored information transform semantics when deducing security labels (e.g., output security label = max over all input security labels). While MLS-like label deduction appears to be conservative, we argue that this approach can result in both underestimation and overestimation of security labels. We contend that overestimation may adversely throttle information flows, while underestimation incites information misuse and leakage."
ACM CCS 2009,Your botnet is my botnet - analysis of a botnet takeover.,"Botnets, networks of malware-infected machines that are controlled by an adversary, are the root cause of a large number of security problems on the Internet. A particularly sophisticated and insidious type of bot is Torpig, a malware program that is designed to harvest sensitive information (such as bank account and credit card data) from its victims. In this paper, we report on our efforts to take control of the Torpig botnet and study its operations for a period of ten days. During this time, we observed more than 180 thousand infections and recorded almost 70 GB of data that the bots collected. While botnets have been ""hijacked"" and studied previously, the Torpig botnet exhibits certain properties that make the analysis of the data particularly interesting. First, it is possible (with reasonable accuracy) to identify unique bot infections and relate that number to the more than 1.2 million IP addresses that contacted our command and control server. Second, the Torpig botnet is large, targets a variety of applications, and gathers a rich and diverse set of data from the infected victims. This data provides a new understanding of the type and amount of personal information that is stolen by botnets."
ACM CCS 2009,On voting machine design for verification and testability.,"We present an approach for the design and analysis of an electronic voting machine based on a novel combination of formal verification and systematic testing. The system was designed specifically to enable verification and testing. In our architecture, the voting machine is a finite-state transducer that implements the bare essentials required for an election. We formally specify how each component of the machine is intended to work and formally verify that a Verilog implementation of our design meets this specification. However, it is more challenging to verify that the composition of these components will behave as a voter would expect, because formalizing human expectations is difficult. We show how systematic testing can be used to address this issue, and in particular to verify that the machine will behave correctly on election day."
ACM CCS 2009,On cellular botnets - measuring the impact of malicious devices on a cellular network core.,"The vast expansion of interconnectivity with the Internet and the rapid evolution of highly-capable but largely insecure mobile devices threatens cellular networks. In this paper, we characterize the impact of the large scale compromise and coordination of mobile phones in attacks against the core of these networks. Through a combination of measurement, simulation and analysis, we demonstrate the ability of a botnet composed of as few as 11,750 compromised mobile phones to degrade service to area-code sized regions by 93%. As such attacks are accomplished through the execution of network service requests and not a constant stream of phone calls, users are unlikely to be aware of their occurrence. We then investigate a number of significant network bottlenecks, their impact on the density of compromised nodes per base station and how they can be avoided. We conclude by discussing a number of countermeasures that may help to partially mitigate the threats posed by such attacks."
ACM CCS 2009,The bayesian traffic analysis of mix networks.,"This work casts the traffic analysis of anonymity systems, and in particular mix networks, in the context of Bayesian inference. A generative probabilistic model of mix network architectures is presented, that incorporates a number of attack techniques in the traffic analysis literature. We use the model to build an Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference engine, that calculates the probabilities of who is talking to whom given an observation of network traces. We provide a thorough evaluation of its correctness and performance, and confirm that mix networks with realistic parameters are secure. This approach enables us to apply established information theoretic anonymity metrics on complex mix networks, and extract information from anonymised traffic traces optimally."
ACM CCS 2009,Membership-concealing overlay networks.,"We introduce the concept of membership-concealing overlay networks (MCONs), which hide the real-world identities of participants. We argue that while membership concealment is orthogonal to anonymity and censorship resistance, pseudonymous communication and censorship resistance become much easier if done over a membership-concealing network. We formalize the concept of membership concealment, discuss a number of attacks against existing systems and present real-world attack results. We then propose three proof-of-concept MCON designs that resist those attacks: one that is more efficient, another that is more robust to membership churn, and a third that balances efficiency and robustness. We show theoretical and simulation results demonstrating the feasibility and performance of our schemes."
ACM CCS 2009,Ripley - automatically securing web 2.0 applications through replicated execution.,"Rich Internet applications are becoming increasingly distributed, as demonstrated by the popularity of AJAX or Web 2.0 applications such as Facebook, Google Maps, Hotmail and many others. A typical multi-tier AJAX application consists, at least, of a server-side component implemented in Java J2EE, PHP or ASP.NET and a client-side component running JavaScript. The resulting application is more responsive because computation has moved closer to the client, avoiding unnecessary network round trips for frequent user actions."
ACM CCS 2009,Countering kernel rootkits with lightweight hook protection.,"Kernel rootkits have posed serious security threats due to their stealthy manner. To hide their presence and activities, many rootkits hijack control flows by modifying control data or hooks in the kernel space. A critical step towards eliminating rootkits is to protect such hooks from being hijacked. However, it remains a challenge because there exist a large number of widely-scattered kernel hooks and many of them could be dynamically allocated from kernel heap and co-located together with other kernel data. In addition, there is a lack of flexible commodity hardware support, leading to the socalled protection granularity gap -- kernel hook protection requires byte-level granularity but commodity hardware only provides page level protection."
ACM CCS 2009,Behavior based software theft detection.,"Along with the burst of open source projects, software theft (or plagiarism) has become a very serious threat to the healthiness of software industry. Software birthmark, which represents the unique characteristics of a program, can be used for software theft detection. We propose a system call dependence graph based software birthmark called SCDG birthmark, and examine how well it reflects unique behavioral characteristics of a program. To our knowledge, our detection system based on SCDG birthmark is the first one that is capable of detecting software component theft where only partial code is stolen. We demonstrate the strength of our birthmark against various evasion techniques, including those based on different compilers and different compiler optimization levels as well as two state-of-the-art obfuscation tools. Unlike the existing work that were evaluated through small or toy software, we also evaluate our birthmark on a set of large software. Our results show that SCDG birthmark is very practical and effective in detecting software theft that even adopts advanced evasion techniques."
ACM CCS 2009,Learning your identity and disease from research papers - information leaks in genome wide association study.,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim at discovering the association between genetic variations, particularly single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and common diseases, which is well recognized to be one of the most important and active areas in biomedical research. Also renowned is the privacy implication of such studies, which has been brought into the limelight by the recent attack proposed by Homer et al. Homer's attack demonstrates that it is possible to identify a GWAS participant from the allele frequencies of a large number of SNPs. Such a threat, unfortunately, was found in our research to be significantly understated. In this paper, we show that individuals can actually be identified from even a relatively small set of statistics, as those routinely published in GWAS papers. We present two attacks. The first one extends Homer's attack with a much more powerful test statistic, based on the correlations among different SNPs described by coefficient of determination (r2). This attack can determine the presence of an individual from the statistics related to a couple of hundred SNPs. The second attack can lead to complete disclosure of hundreds of participants' SNPs, through analyzing the information derived from published statistics. We also found that those attacks can succeed even when the precisions of the statistics are low and part of data is missing. We evaluated our attacks on the real human genomes and concluded that such threats are completely realistic."
ACM CCS 2009,Privacy-preserving genomic computation through program specialization.,"In this paper, we present a new approach to performing important classes of genomic computations (e.g., search for homologous genes) that makes a significant step towards privacy protection in this domain. Our approach leverages a key property of the human genome, namely that the vast majority of it is shared across humans (and hence public), and consequently relatively little of it is sensitive. Based on this observation, we propose a privacy-protection framework that partitions a genomic computation, distributing the part on sensitive data to the data provider and the part on the pubic data to the user of the data. Such a partition is achieved through program specialization that enables a biocomputing program to perform a concrete execution on public data and a symbolic execution on sensitive data. As a result, the program is simplified into an efficient query program that takes only sensitive genetic data as inputs. We prove the effectiveness of our techniques on a set of dynamic programming algorithms common in genomic computing. We develop a program transformation tool that automatically instruments a legacy program for specialization operations. We also demonstrate that our techniques can greatly facilitate secure multi-party computations on large biocomputing problems."
ACM CCS 2009,Feeling-based location privacy protection for location-based services.,"Anonymous location information may be correlated with restricted spaces such as home and office for subject re-identification. This makes it a great challenge to provide location privacy protection for users of location-based services. Existing work adopts traditional K-anonymity model and ensures that each location disclosed in service requests is a spatial region that has been visited by at least K users. This strategy requires a user to specify an appropriate value of K in order to achieve a desired level of privacy protection. This is problematic because privacy is about feeling, and it is awkward for one to scale her feeling using a number. In this paper, we propose a feeling-based privacy model. The model allows a user to express her privacy requirement by specifying a public region, which the user would feel comfortable if the region is reported as her location. The popularity of the public region, measured using entropy based on its visitors' footprints inside it, is then used as the user's desired level of privacy protection. With this model in place, we present a novel technique that allows a user's location information to be reported as accurate as possible while providing her sufficient location privacy protection. The new technique supports trajectory cloaking and can be used in application scenarios where a user needs to make frequent location updates along a trajectory that cannot be predicted. In addition to evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed technique under various conditions through simulation, we have also implemented an experimental system for location privacy-aware uses of location-based services."
ACM CCS 2009,Filter-resistant code injection on ARM.,"Code injections attacks are one of the most powerful and important classes of attacks on software. In such attacks, the attacker sends malicious input to a software application, where it is stored in memory. The malicious input is chosen in such a way that its representation in memory is also a valid representation of a machine code program that performs actions chosen by the attacker. The attacker then triggers a bug in the application to divert the control flow to this injected machine code. A typical action of the injected code is to launch a command interpreter shell, and hence the malicious input is often called shellcode."
